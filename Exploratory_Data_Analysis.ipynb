not returned home airplane \\nhad taken the Stellar only because the peacefulness ocean liner travel would aid his thoughts and required time marshal them Liner travel was now luxury all save the immensely wealthy traveled plane across the oceans Now Prester Kleig was sorry for any moment felt Moyen might strike \\nturned and looked back along the deck the Stellar His eyes played over the trimly gowned figure the woman who questioned the steward but did not really see her And then \\nGreat God The words were prayer and they burst from the lips Prester Kleig like explosion Passengers appeared from the lee lifeboats Officers the bridge whirled look the man who shouted Seamen paused their labors stare Aloft the crow nest the lookout lowered his eyes from scouring the horizon stare Prester Kleig who was pointing \\nAll eyes turned the direction indicated \\n \\nClimbing into the sky mile off the starboard beam was airplane with bulbous body and queerly slanted wings had neither wheels nor pontoons and traveled with unbelievable speed came bullet fast headed directly for the side the Stellar \\nLower the boats yelled Kleig Lower the boats For God sake lower the boats \\nFor Prester Kleig that casual turning had seen what none aboard the Stellar even the lookout above had seen The airplane which had neither wheels nor pontoons had risen Aphrodite said have risen out the waves had seen the wings come out the bulbous body snap backward into place and the plane was full flight the instant appeared \\nPrester Kleig had hope that his warning would time but would always feel better for having given the captain debated with himself whether this lunatic should confined dangerous the strange airplane nosed over and dived down the sea hundred yards from the side the Stellar Just before struck the water its wings snapped forward and became part the bulbous body the thing the whole which shot like bullet into the sea \\n \\nPrester Kleig stood the rail peering out the spot where the plane had plunged with scarcely splash and his right hand was raised though gave final despairing signal \\nall aboard the Stellar only saw that black streak which ten feet under water raced like bolt lightning from the nose the submerged but visible plane straight die for the side the Stellar Just black streak bigger than small man arm from the nose the plane the side the Stellar \\nFrom the crow nest came the startled terrific voice the lookout the beginning cry that must remain forever inarticulate \\nThe world that blinding moment seemed rock its foundations shatter itself bits chaotic jumble sound and movement shot through and through with lurid flames Kleig felt himself hurled upward and outward turned over and over endlessly \\nfelt the storm tossed waters close over him and knew had struck the moment knew oblivion deep ebon and impenetrable blotted out knowledge \\nCHAPTER \\nThe Half Dream \\nroaring rushing river chaotic sound first Jumbled sound which Prester Kleig could give adequate name But tried analyze its meanings was able differentiate between sounds and discover the identity some \\nThe river sound decided the sound vibrational explosion some sort vibrational because had that quivery quality which causes feeling uneasiness and fret that feeling which makes one turn and look around find the eyes boring into one back yet multiplied its intensity uncounted number times \\nOther sounds which came through the chaotic river sound were the terrified screaming the men and women who were doomed Lifeboats were never lowered for the reason that with the disintegration the Stellar everything inanimate aboard her likewise disintegrated dropping men and women crew and passengers into the freezing waters the Atlantic \\nPrester Kleig dropped with them only partially unconscious after the first icy plunge knew when floated the surface for felt himself lifted and hurled the waves his half dream saw men and women being carried away into wave shrouded darkness clawing wildly nothingness for support clawing one another locking arms and going down together \\n \\nThe Stellar the merest matter seconds had become spoil the sea and her crew and passengers had vanished forever from the sight men Yet Prester Kleig lived knew that lived and that there was element too strong disbelieved reality his dream \\nThere was vibratory sense too the near activity noiseless motor Noiseless motor Where had last thought those two words With what recent catastrophe were they associated could not recall though knew should able \\nThen the sense motion the front was apparent unnumbered sense rather than concrete feeling Motion front influenced the rising and falling motion mountainous waves \\nsuddenly distinct shock the wave motion ceased though the forward motion and upward not only continued but increased \\nThat airplane the bulbous body the queerly slanted wings \\nBut the glimmering realization vanished sickishly sweet odor assailed his nostrils and sent its swift moving tentacles upward wrap themself soothingly about his brain But the sense flight unbelievably swift was present and recognizable though all else eluded him had the impression however that was intended that all save the most vagrant most widely differentiated impressions elude him that should acquire only half pictures which would therefore all the more terrible retrospect \\nThe only impressions which were real were those motion the front and upward and the sense noiseless machinery vibrating the whole nearby \\nThen distinct realization the cessation the sense flying and return though lesser degree the rising and falling waves This latter sensation became less and less though the feeling traveling downward continued Prester Kleig knew that was going down into the sea again down into deeply Then that odor once more and the elusive memory \\nForward motion last the depths swift forward motion though Prester Kleig could not even guess the direction Just swift motion and the mutter voices the giving orders \\n \\nPrester Kleig regained consciousness fully the sands the shore sat stiffly staring out sea storm was raging and the sea was angry waste ship showed the waters the mad tumbled sky above was either empty planes they had climbed invisibility above the clouds that raced and churned with the storm \\nOut the storm almost Prester Kleig feet dropped small airplane Through the window familiar face peered Kleig helmeted begoggled figure opened the door and stepped out \\nKleig old man said the flyer you gave the right dope all right but swear there isn wireless tower within hundred miles this place How did you manage \\nKane you crazy But Prester Kleig could not with the thought which had rushed through his brain with the numbing impact blow grasped the hand Carlos Kane the Domestic Service and the yellow flimsy Kane held out him read simply \\nShipwrecked ashore There followed grid coordinate map readings Come once prepared fly Washington was signed Kleig \\nKane said Kleig did not send this message \\nWhat more was there said Horror looked out the eyes Prester Kleig and was reflected those Carlos Kane Both men turned peering out across the tumbled welter waters \\nSomewhere out there tight locked the gloomy archives the Atlantic was the secret the message which had brought Carlos Kane Prester Kleig and the agency which had sent \\nCHAPTER III \\nWings morrow \\nPrester Kleig climbed into the enclosed passenger pit the monoplane Mayther his ears seemed literally ringing with the drumming mighty voice Moyen But now that voice instead merely speaking rang with sardonic laughter had never heard the laughter Moyen but could guess how would sound \\nThat airplane the slanted wings the bulbous almost bulletlike fuselage what was simple Kleig looked back his memoried glimpse The submarine was metal fish made with human hands the airplane aped the birds The strange ship which had caused the destruction the Stellar was combination fish and bird which merely aped nature bit further anyone who had ever traversed tropical waters would have instantly recognized \\nBut what did portend What ghastly terrors Moyen roamed the deeps the Atlantic the Pacific the oceans the world How close were some these the United States \\nThe pale eyes Moyen was sure were already turned toward the West \\n \\nPrester Kleig sighed seated himself beside Carlos Kane Then Kane pressed one the myriad buttons the dash and Kleig lifted his eyes peer through the skylight where that single press button had set motion the intricate machinery the helicopter \\nfour bladed fan lifted slender pedestal sufficiently high above the surface the wing for the vanes free the central propeller Then automatically the vanes became invisible and the Mayther lifted from the sandy beach lightly and far more straightly than any bird \\nthe ship climbed away for the skies and through the transparent floor the beach and the Atlantic fell away below the ship sigh relief escaped Kleig This was living here one was free only for moment and the swift wind flight brushed all cobwebs from the tired human brain watched the slender needle the altimeter moved around the face the dial steadily the hands clock around thirty thousand thirty five forty \\nThen Carlos Kane every movement effortless the flight the silvery winged Mayther thrust forth his hand the dash again pressed another button Instantly the propellers vanished into blur the vanes the helicopter dropped down the slender staff and the vanes themselves fitted snugly into their appointed notches atop the wing \\n \\nFor second Carlos Kane glanced the tiny map the right the dash and set his course was matter moments only but while Kane worked Prester Kleig studied the instruments the dash for had been months since had flown save for his recent half dreamlike experience There was button which released the mechanism the deadly guns fired compressed air all operated from the noiseless motor whose muzzles exactly cleared the tips Mayther wings two guns each wing one the entering edge one the trailing edge fitted snugly into the adamant rigging \\nFour guns which could fire right left twin streams lead the number rounds governed only the carrying power the Mayther Prester Kleig knew them all the guns the wings the guns which fired through the three propellers and the guns set two and two the fuselage right and left the pits which could fixed either down all the mere pressing buttons was marvelous miraculous yet even Kleig told himself that this was felt deep the heart him that Moyen knew all about ships like these and regarded them the toys children \\nKane touched Kleig the shoulder signaling indicating that the atmosphere the pits had been regulated their new height and that they could remove their helmets and oxygen tanks without danger \\n \\nWith sigh Prester Kleig sat back and the two friends turned face each other \\nYou certainly look done Kleig said Kane sympathetically You must have been through hell and then some Tell about this Moyen that you think you care talk about him \\nTalk about him repeated Kleig Talk about him will relief There has been nothing and nobody mind save Moyen for weary months end don talk someone about him mad not mad already Moyen monster with the face angel What else can one say about him devil and saint brute whose followers would with him into hell fire and sing him hosannas they were consumed agony The greatest mob psychologist the world has ever seen genius Kane and unless something done the Western world all the world doomed sit the feet listen the commands Moyen \\nisn Oriental isn European isn negroid Indian but there something about him that makes one thing all these singly and collectively His body twisted and grotesque and when one looks his face one feels desire touch him swear eternal fealty him until one looks into his pale eyes eyes almost milky their paleness and gets the merest hint the thoughts which actuate him has failing did not find does not drink gamble \\nAnd women queried Kane softly \\n \\nKleig was madly love with the sister Kane Charmion and this thing touched him nearest the heart because Charmion was one her country most famous beauties about whom Moyen must already have heard \\nWomen repeated Kleig musingly his black eyes troubled haunted scarcely know has love for women only because has capacity for any love save self love But when think him this connection seem see Moyen grown monster proportions sitting mighty throne with nude women groveling his feet bathed tears their long hair mantles sorrow hiding their shamed faces That sounds wild doesn But the picture get Moyen when think Moyen and women Many women will love him and have perhaps But while has taken many though only guessing here has given himself none Another thing His followers well sets limits the lusts his men requiring only that every soldier fit for duty with body strong for hardship You understand \\nKane understood and his face was very pale \\nYes said his voice almost whisper understand and you speak this man seem see city ruins and hordes men marching bloodstained men entering houses from which immediately afterward come the screams women terror stricken women \\nshuddered and could not for the very horror the vision that had come him \\nBut Kleig stared him though saw ghost \\nGreat God Carl gasped The same identical picture has been mind not once but thousand times wonder \\nWas omen the future for the West \\nDeep his soul Prester Kleig fancied could hear the sardonic laughter the half god Moyen \\n \\ntiny bell rang inside the dash behind the instruments Kane had set direction finders had pressed the button which signaled the Washington control Station the National Radio thus automatically indicating the exact spot above land grid coordinates where the Mayther should start down for the landing \\nhour later they landed the flat roof the new Capitol Building sinking lightly rest feather nursed gentle landing the whirring vanes the helicopter \\nPrester Kleig surrounded uniformed guards who tried shield him from the gaze news gatherers crowded there the roof top hurried him the stairway leading into the executive chambers and through these the Secret Chamber which only few men knew and into which not even Carlos Kane could follow Prester Kleig yet \\nBut one man one news gatherer had caught glimpse the face Kleig and already raced for the radio tower his organization blazon the Western world the fact that Kleig had come back \\nCHAPTER \\nNation Waits Dread \\nPrester Kleig looking twice his forty years because fatigue and almost nameless terrors through which had passed went his rendezvous the news gatherer who shall here remain nameless raced for the Broadcasting Tower \\nPrester Kleig entered the Secret Room and signal all the many doors behind him along that interminable stairway swung shut and were tightly locked the news gatherer raced for the microphone and gave the priority signal the operator Millions people would not only hear the words the news gatherer but would see him note the expressions which chased one another across his face For television was long since accomplished everyday fact \\nPrester Kleig this government Secret Service has just returned the United Americas Your informer has just seen him step from the monoplane Carlos Kane atop the Capitol Building and repair once the Secret Room closely guarded But saw his face and though under forty seems twice that And you know now what this country has only guessed before that has seen Moyen Moyen the half man half god the enigma the ages What does Prester Kleig think this man doesn say for dares not speak yet But your informer saw his face and old and twisted with terror And \\n \\nThat ended the discourse the news gatherer and was many hours before the public really understood For with new sentence but half completed the picture the news gatherer faded blackly off the screens million homes and his voice was blotted out humming that mounted terrific appalling shriek Some terrible agency about which people who knew their radio could only guess had drowned out the words the news gatherer leaving the public stunned and bewildered almost groping before feeling terror which was all the more unbearable because none could give name \\nAnd the public had heard but fraction the truth merely that Kleig had come back had been the intention the government deny the public even this knowledge and had but knowledge the denial itself was public property which filled the hearts men and women all through the Western Hemisphere with nameless dread And over all this abode countless millions hovered the shadow Moyen \\nThe government tried correct the impression which the news gatherer had given out \\nPrester Kleig back said the radio while the government speaker tried for the benefit those who could see him smile reassuringly But there nothing cause anyone the slightest concern has seen Moyen yes and has heard him speak but still there nothing distress anyone and the whole story will given you soon possible Kleig has gone into the Secret Room yes but every operative the government when discussing business connected with diplomatic relations with foreign powers received the Secret Room cause for worry \\n \\nwas easy say that and the speaker realized which was why could but with difficulty make his smile seem reassuring \\nTell the truth and tell quickly might have been the voiceless cries those who listened and saw the face and fidgeting form the speaker But the words were not spoken because the people sensed hovering horror dread catastrophe beyond the power words express and looked one another silence their eyes wide with dread their hearts throbbing suffocation with nameless foreboding \\neyes were horror haunted and men walked flew and rode fear and trembling while down the Secret Room Prester Kleig and dozen old men men wise the ways science and invention wise the ways men and beasts Nature and the Infinite Outside decided the fate the Nation \\nThat Secret Room was closed every one Not even the news gatherers could reach not even the all seeing eye the telephotograph emblazoned the world its secrets \\nBut was secret \\nPerhaps Moyen the master mobster smiled when heard men say men who knew their hearts that Moyen regarded other earthlings earthlings regard children and their toys Did the eyes Moyen gaze even into the depths the Secret Room hundreds feet below even the documentary treasure vaults the Capitol \\n \\none knew the answer the question but the radio reporting the return Kleig had given the public distorted vision embodied fear and its heart the public answered Yes And what had drowned out the voice the radio reporter \\nwonder that for many hours nation waited fear and trembling eyes filled with dread that was nameless and absolute for word from the Secret Room Fear mounted and mounted the hours passed and word came \\nthat room Prester Kleig and the twelve old men one whom was the country President held counsel with the man who had come back But before the spoken counsel had been held awesome and awe inspiring pictures had flashed across the screen invented third the old men from which the world held secrets even the secrets Moyen \\nWith this mechanism guarded forfeit the lives score men the men the Secret Room could peer into even the most secret places the world The old men had peered and had seen things which had blanched their pale cheeks anew And when they had finished and the terrible pictures had faded out voice had spoken suddenly like explosion the Secret Room \\nWell gentlemen are you satisfied that resistance futile \\nJust the voice but one man the Secret Room and the others when his numbing lips spoke the name was far more than enough For not even the wisest the great men could explain how they knew having just seen him there man could Madagascar while his voice spoke aloud the Secret Room where even radio was barred \\nThe name the lips Prester Kleig \\nMoyen Moyen \\nCHAPTER \\nMonsters the Deep \\nGentlemen said Prester Kleig entered the Secret Room where sat the scientists and inventive geniuses the Americas haven much time and shall waste but little Moyen ready strike hasn already done believe will see matter seconds Professor Maniel shall need first all your apparatus for returning the vibratory images events which have transpired within the last thirty six hours \\nwish show those you who failed see the sinking the Stellar which was passenger and believe the only survivor \\nProfessor Maniel strangely mouse like save for the ponderous dome his forehead stepped away from the circular table without word had invented the machine question and was inordinately proud Through its use could pick the sounds and the pictures events which had transpired down the past centuries from the tinkling the cymbals Miriam all the horror the conflict men had called the Great War simply drawing back from the ether the sounds fled outward through space those sounds and vibrations which needed \\nHis science was exact one more carefully exact even than the measurement the speed light taking into consideration the dispersion sound and movement and the element time \\nThe interior the Secret Room became dark Maniel labored with his minute machinery Only behind the screen the wall rear the table was there light \\n \\nThe voice Maniel began drone thought aloud \\nThere matter but few minutes difference time between Washington and the last recorded location the Stellar The sinking occurred ten thirty last evening you say Kleig yes have Watch carefully gentlemen \\nsilent were the Secret Agents one could not even have heard the breathing one them for the screen misty first but becoming moment moment bolder outline was the face storm tossed sea The liner was slower forming and was slightly out focus for second two \\nsaid Professor Maniel There \\nThrough the sound apparatus came the roaring and moaning storm sea the screen the Stellar rose high the waves dropped into the trough while spumes black smoke spread rearward the waters from her spouting funnels Figures were visible her decks figures which seemed carved bronze \\nthe prow every expression his face plainly visible stood Prester Kleig himself and his picture appeared was the act turning \\nNow said Kleig himself there the Secret Room look off the left gentlemen mile from the Stellar \\nrustling sound the scientists shifted their places \\n \\nThey all saw and gasp burst from their lips though signal For the Stellar seemed about plunge off the shadowed screen into the Secret Room flying thing had risen out the sea airplane with bulbous body and queerly slanting wings \\nthe same time out the mouth the pictured figure Prester Kleig clear and agonized the tones bell struck frenzy the words \\nGreat God Lower the boats Lower the boats For God sake lower the boats \\nthe Secret Room the real Prester Kleig spoke again \\nWhen the black streak leaves the nose the plane after has submerged Professor Maniel said Kleig softly slow your mechanism that can see the whole thing detail \\nThere came grunted affirmative from Professor Maniel \\nThe nose the pictured plane tilted over diving down for the surface the sea \\nNow snapped Kleig Don wait \\nInstantly the moving pictures the screen reduced their speed and the plane appeared stop its sudden seaward plunge and drop down lightly feather The wings the thing moved forward slowly folding into the body the dropping plane \\nThey fold forward said Kleig quietly that the speed the plane the take off will snap them backward into position for flying \\n \\none spoke because the explanation was obvious \\nSlowly the airplane went down the surface the sea with scarcely plume spindrift leaping back after she had struck She dropped ten feet below the surface the water hundred yards off the starboard beam the Stellar her blunt nose pointing squarely the side the doomed liner \\nNow said Kleig hoarsely watch closely for God sake \\nThe liner rose and fell slowly Out the nose the plane which had now become tiny submarine started narrow tube black oddly like the sepia giant squid Straight toward the side the liner went Above the rail the Secret Agents could see the pictured form Prester Kleig hand upraised The black streak reached the side the Stellar \\ntouched the metal plates spreading upon impact growing enlarging right and left upward and downward and where touched the Stellar the black seemed erase that portion the ship the slow motion every detail was apparent regular speed the blotting out the Stellar would have been instantaneous \\nKleig saw himself rise slowly from the vanished rail turning over and over going down the sea almost closed his eyes bit his lips keep back the cries terror when saw the others aboard the liner rise turn over and over and fly all directions like jackstraws high wind \\n \\nThe ship was erased from beneath passengers and crew and passengers and crew fell into the sea Out the depths from all directions came the starving denizens the sea starving because liners now were few \\nThat enough that Professor snapped Kleig Now jump ahead approximately eight hours and see you can pick that aero sub after dropped the Jersey Coast \\nThe picture faded out quickly the screaming doomed human beings already hours dead called back apparent living the genius Maniel died away and for space the screen was blank \\nThen the sea again storm tossed before shifting here and there Maniel sought the immensity sea and sky for the thing desired \\nTwo hundred miles south east New York City droned There gentlemen \\nThey all saw then full flight eight thousand feet above the surface the Atlantic traveling south east dizzy rate speed \\nNote said Kleig that keeps safely the low altitudes order escape the notice regular air traffic \\none answered \\nThe eyes the Secret Agents were that flashing bulbous bodied plane the strange wings appeared heading directly for some objective which must reached top speed \\n \\nFor fifteen minutes the flight continued Then the plane tilted over and dived and altitude still three thousand feet the wings slashed forward clicking into their notches the sides the bulbous body with sound like the ratchets subway turnstiles and holding their breath the Secret Agents watched plummet down the sea was traveling with terrific speed when struck yet entered the water with scarcely splash \\nThen for the first time audible gasp that one person came from the lips the Secret Agents For now they could see the objective the aero sub monster shadow the water depth five hundred feet shadow which Maniel manipulated his instruments became floating underwater fortress ten times the size any submarine known the Americas \\nSporting like porpoises about this held suspension fortress were myriads other aero subs maneuvering squadrons and flights weaving and out like schools fish The plane which had bourne Prester Kleig churned between two the formations and vanished into the side the motionless monster the deep \\nThe striking deep sea bell muted tons and tons water sounded the Secret Room \\nDon turn off Maniel said Kleig There more yet \\nAnd there was for the sound the bell was signal The aero subs darting outward from the side the floating fortress like fish darting out seaweed were plunging toward the surface the Atlantic Breathlessly the Secret Agents watched them \\nThey broke water like flying fish and their wings shot backward from their notches the myriad bulbous bodies click into place flying position the scores aero subs took the air above the invisible hiding places the mother submarine \\n \\neight thousand feet the aero subs swung into battle formation and though controlled word command they maneuvered there like one vast machine central control beautiful the flight swallows deadly anything that flew \\nThe Secret Agents swept the cold sweat from their brows and sighs terror escaped them all \\nthat moment came the voice loud the Secret Room which Kleig least immediately recognized \\nWell gentlemen are you satisfied that resistance futile \\nAnd Kleig whispered the name over and over again \\nMoyen Moyen \\nwas Prester Kleig Master the Secret Room who was the first regain control after the nerve numbing question which asked far Madagascar was heard the Agents the Secret Room \\n shouted   Moyen the end will beat you \\nOnly silence answered but deep the heart Prester Kleig sounded burst sardonic laughter the laughter Moyen half god Asia Then the voice again \\nThe attack beginning gentlemen Within hour you will have further evidence the might Moyen \\nCHAPTER \\nVanishing Ships \\nPrester Kleig ordered Madagascar from the Secret Room had been merely operative honored above others that had been one the few that time ever visit the Secret Room Now however because had walked closer Moyen than anyone else assumed leadership almost natural right and the men who had once deferred him took orders from him \\nGentlemen snapped while the last words Moyen still hung the air the Secret Room must fight Moyen from here The best brains the United Americas are gathered here and Moyen can beaten can beaten will beaten from the Secret Room \\nsigh from the lips Professor Maniel The President the United Americas nodded his head though too mutely gave authority into the hands Prester Kleig The other Secret Agents shifted slightly but said nothing \\nhave been away year said Kleig you know and many things have come into regular use since left Professor Maniel machine for example upon which was working when departed under orders There will further use for our struggle with Moyen Professor will you kindly range the ocean beginning once and see how many these monsters Moyen have contend with \\n \\nProfessor Maniel turned back his instruments which fondled with gentle loving hands \\nhave nothing with which combat the attacking forces Moyen went Kleig save antiquated airplanes and such obsolete warships are available These will mere fodder for the guns rays whatever that Moyen uses his aero subs Thousands perhaps millions human lives will lost but better this than that Moyen rule the West Better this than that our women given into the hands this mob spoils war \\nFrom the Secret Agents murmur assent \\nAnd then that voice again startling clear with the slightest suggestion some Oriental accent the Secret Room \\nnot depend too much gentlemen said upon your antiquated warships See merciful that not allow you send them against loaded with men slaughtered drowned Professor Maniel would ask you turn that plaything yours and gaze upon the fleet obsolete ships anchored Hampton Roads passing Professor venture guess that the secret how able talk with you gentlemen here your Secret Room secret all you Now look \\nThe Secret Agents gasped again consternation \\nFrom the white lips mouselike Maniel came mumbled words even his hands worked with lightning speed \\nHis machine simply variation own And gentlemen compatriots with could easily project himself bodily here into the room with \\n \\nSomething like suppressed scream from one the men present cold hand ice about the heart Prester Kleig But the words Professor Maniel were limned the retina his brain letters fire Suppose Moyen were project himself into the Secret Room \\nBut would not was fool and even these Secret Agents most whom were old and longer strong would have torn him limb from limb But those words Maniel set whirling once more and new direction the thoughts Prester Kleig \\nPresident gentlemen was the voice Professor Maniel \\nAll eyes turned again the screen upon which the professor worked his miracles which today were commonplaces which yesterday had been undreamed Every Secret Agent recognized the outlines Hampton Roads with Norfolk and its towering buildings the background and the obsolete warships riding silently anchor the roadstead \\nFor three years they had been there while procrastinating Cabinet Congress and Senate had debated their permanent disposal They represented millions dollars money and were utterly worthless Prester Kleig looking them now could see them putting out sea loaded with brave visaged men volunteering sure destruction feed the rapacity Moyen hordes Men going out sea tubs singing \\nBut these ships were silent plumes smoke from their funnels Like floating mausoleums filled with dead hopes shells past and departed glories \\nThe beating waves against their sides could plainly heard The anchor chains squeaked rustily the hawse holes Wind sighed through regal towering superstructures and man walked the decks any one them \\n \\nWith bated breath the Secret Agents watched \\nWhy had Moyen bidden them turn their attention these shells erstwhile naval grandeur \\nThis time gasps broke from the lips the Secret Agents Not even the sound breathing could heard Just the sighing wind through the superstructures hundred ships the whispering waves against rusted bulkheads \\nAlmost imperceptibly first the towering dreadnought the foreground began move Slowly the water swirling about her she backed away from her anchor tightening the curve the anchor chain Water quivered about the point the chain contact with the waves \\nQuickly the eyes the Secret Agents swept along the street ships The same backward motion dragging against their anchor chains was visible the bow each warship \\nWith not soul aboard them the ships were waking into strange and awesome life dragging their anchors like hounds pulling leashes free and away \\nHow are they doing was almost whisper from the President \\nSome electro magnetic force sir stated Prester Kleig Professor Blaine that your province Please note what happening and advise once you see how they are doing \\ngrunt affirmation from surly obese Professor Blaine \\n \\nAll eyes turned back again the miracle the moving ships One one with crashes which echoed and echoed through the Secret Room the anchor chains the dreadnoughts parted The ends them swung from the prows the warships while the severed portions splashed into the Roads and the waters hid them from view \\nThe great dreadnought the foreground swung slowly about until her prow was pointed the direction the open sea and though sea was running smoke rose from her funnels she got slowly ponderously under way and started out the Roads Behind her formation the other ships swung into line \\nmatter seconds faster than any these vessels had ever traveled before they were racing column for the open Atlantic And from the sound apparatus came wails and shrieks terror the lamentations men and women frightened they had never been frightened before \\nThe shores behind the moving column ships was moment moment growing blacker with people black sea people whose faces were white chalk with terror \\nBut out sea moved the column brave ships \\nnew note entered into the picture from all sides airplanes many makes swooped and swept back and forth over the moving ships while hooded heads looked out pits and faces pilots were aghast what they saw \\n \\nghost column ships moving out sea speed increasing moment moment unbelievably Even now five minutes after the first dreadnought had started seaward the wake each ship spread away either hand the two sides watery triangle whose walls were dozen feet high racing for the shores with all the sullen majesty tidal waves \\nThe crowds gave back and their screams rose into the air frightened roar appalling sound \\nEven now rapidly did the warships travel many the planes could throttle down that they flew directly above the heaving decks the runaway warships \\nGet word them cried Prester Kleig suddenly Get word them that they follow the ships out sea not pilot will escape alive \\nOne the Secret Agents rose and hurried from the Secret Room traveling top speed for the first the many doors enroute the broadcasting tower from which all the planes could reached once Prester Kleig turned back the magic screen Maniel \\nThe warships water thrown aside the lifting thrust their forefeet mountains that raced landward with ever increasing fury were clearing the Roads and swinging south east heading into the wastes the Atlantic they cleared the land and open water for unnumbered miles lay ahead the speed the mighty ships increased point where they rode high the water racing launches and the creaking and groaning their rusty bolts and spars were continual paean protest the sound apparatus accompanying the showing the miracle the screen \\nThey heading straight for the spot where that super submarine lies said the President and one answered him \\n \\nPrester Kleig watching was racing over his mind what could recall his country armament Warships were useless was being proved here before his eyes But there still remained airplanes countless numbers which could diverted from ocean travel and from routine business battle this menace Moyen \\nBut \\nshuddered pictured his mind eye the meeting his country flower flying manhood with the monsters Moyen \\nHis eyes thought were watching the racing those ocean greyhounds out sea They were now out sight land and still some the planes followed them \\nhalf hour passed and then \\nThe American pilots obedience the radio signals turning back from this strange phenomenon the ghost column capital ships \\nSimultaneously out the sky dead ahead dropped the first flight Moyen aero subs \\nthe same moment the mysterious power which had dragged the ships sea was withdrawn and the warships with hands guide them swung whither they willed and floated many directions there were ships under their forward momentum There were score collisions and some the ships were sinking condition even before the aero subs began their labors \\n \\nThe remaining ships floated high out the water because they carried ballast and from all sides the aero subs Moyen settled the task destruction destruction which was simply warning what was come Moyen manner proving the Americas the fact that was all powerful \\nGod what fools cried Prester Kleig \\nThe rearmost the American aviators had looked back had seen the first the aero subs drop down among the doomed ships Instantly turned out sea again signalling did the nearest other planes And spite the radio warning hundred planes answered that signal and swept back investigate this new mystery \\nThey going death groaned the President \\nYes said Kleig softly but saves ordering others death Perhaps may learn something value watch them die \\nCHAPTER VII \\nGolden Oblivion \\nThis said Prester Kleig coldly precise judge pronouncing sentence death will precipitate the major engagement with Moyen forces The fools rush like this when they have been warned But even they are magnificent \\nThe pilots the aero subs must instantly have noticed the return the American pilots for some the aero subs which had dropped the ocean surface rose again almost instantly and swept into battle formation above the drifting hulks the warships \\nThe Americans were wary They drew together like frightened chickens when hawk hovers above them and watched the activities the aero subs every move each one being the same time visible and audible the Secret Agents the Capitol Secret Room \\nThe aero subs which had submerged singled out their particular prey among the floating ships and the Secret Agents trying see how each separate act destruction was accomplished watched the aero sub the foreground which happened concentrating the dreadnought which had led the ghost march the warships out sea \\n \\nThe aero sub circled the swaying dreadnought shark circles wreck and through the walls the aero sub the watchers the Secret Room could see the four man crew the thing Grim faced men men the Orient they plainly were coldly concentrating the work hand Their faces were those men who are merciless even brutal with neither heart nor compassion any kind for weaker ones One man maneuvered the aero sub while the other three concentrated the apparatus the nose the hybrid vessel \\nSee spoke Prester Kleig again you can tell what manner ray they use and how projected That your province General Munson \\nFrom the particular Secret Agent named who was expert for war the membership the Secret Room came short grunt affirmation few murmured words \\nable tell more about when see how they operate when they are flying That black streak under water well must see out the water and then \\nBut here General Munson ended for the aero sub which they were especially watching had got into action against the dreadnought \\nThe aero sub was motionless and submerged just off the port bow the dreadnought The three men inside the aero sub were working swiftly and efficiently with the complicated but minute machinery the nose their transport \\ncan controlled then this ray said Munson interrupting himself Watch \\n \\nFrom the nose the aero sub leaped like streak black lightning that ebon agency death struck the prow the battleship and the prow far aft the well deck simply vanished from sight disintegrated was though had never been and for second swiftly had happened the water the ocean held the impression that portion the warship had made explosive leaves crater the soil earth \\nThen drumming roar the sea rushed claim its own The roaring Niagara the waters claimed the ship rushing down passageways into the hold possessing the warship with all the invincible speedy might the sea \\nMingled with this roaring was the shivering vibratory sound which Prester Kleig had experienced his half dream The sound was intense that fairly rocked the Secret Room its furthermost cranny \\nFor second the dreadnought wounded death seemed shudder hesitate then move backward though wincing from her death blow was the pound the inrushing waters which did Then came the stern the mighty ship she started her last long plunge into the depths \\nBut attention had swung another warship the starboard beam which another aero sub had taken position Again the ebon streak death from her blunt nose smashing and through the warship directly amidships cutting her twain though the black streak had been pair shears the warship strip tissue paper \\nwent the prow and the stern this one and together the water separating the two parts rushed into the gap the broken warship went down its final resting place \\n \\nAbruptly Professor Maniel swung back the American planes which had come back investigate the activities the aero subs and the screen the midst the battle formation into which the pilots had swept hurriedly the Secret Agents could see the faces those pilots \\nWhite chalk with fear mouths open gasping unbelief One man pale faced youth was the first recover stared around his compatriots and plainly through the sound apparatus the Secret Room came his swift radio signals \\nAttack Who will follow against these people \\nHis signals were very plain too were the answers the other pilots and the heart Prester Kleig swelled with pride listened the answering signals and counted them discovered that every last pilot there present elected stay with this youngster avenge their country for this contemptuous insult which had been put upon her the rape Hampton Roads \\nInto swift formation they swept and with these planes all planes use were required franchise operating companies equipped for the emergencies war swung into echelon formation the youthful pilot leading mutual consent \\nThey swept full speed toward the warships four which had this time been sent destruction one which had appeared vanish utterly the space single heartbeat quickly that for second two the shape its bilge the bulge its keel was visible the face the deep and openly challenged the aero subs \\n \\nMuzzles compressed air guns projected from the wing tips the planes Buttons were pressed which elevated the muzzles guns arranged fire upward from either side the fighting pits twin guns that were fired downward from the same central magazine the only guns use the Americas which fired opposite directions the same time \\nBut for few moments the aero subs refused combat Their speed was terrific dazzling They eluded the thrusts the dives and plunges the American ships easily swallow eludes the dive buzzard \\ncame Prester Kleig however that the aero subs were merely playing with the Americans that when they elected move the planes would blasted from the sky easily the warships were being erased from the surface the Atlantic \\nOne one methodically machines the aero sub pilots blasted the warships into nothingness They had their orders and they went about their performance with rigidity discipline which astounded the Secret Agents They had been ordered destroy the warships and they were doing that first would completion this task matter how many American planes buzzed about their ears \\nBut one one the warships sank the aero subs which had either sunk erased them made the surface and leaped into space with snapping back wings that was horribly businesslike sound and climbed take part the fight against the American planes which must inevitably come \\n \\nThe last warship cut squarely two from stem stern along her center though split thus bolt lightning fell apart like pieces cake and splashed down sinking away while the spume her disintegration rolled back from her fallen sides white crested waves \\nexemplifies the policies Moyen said Prester Kleig for his conquest the world conquest destruction \\nThe last aero sub took the sky and the Americans rushed into battle with fine disregard for what they knew must certain death They were not fools exactly and they had seen but not understood the manner which those gallant old hounds the sea had been erased from existence \\nBut they went plunging squarely into the heart the aero subs leading formation which formation consisted three aero subs flying wing and wing formation \\nThe young American signaled with upraised hand and the American pilots made their first move Every plane started rolling dazzling speed the axis its fuselage while bullets spewed from the guns that fired through the propellers \\nBullets smashed into the leading aero subs with apparent effect though for second seemed that the central aero sub the leading formation hesitated for moment flight \\nThen swift had that black streak flashed from the nose aero subs submerged streak darted from the nose the central aero sub and glistened the sun like molten gold \\n \\ntouched the youngster who had called for volunteers for his attack against this strange enemy touched his plane and the plane vanished instantly while for fraction second the pilot was visible his place the posture sitting hand row buttons which did not exist head forward slightly aimed guns that had vanished \\nThen the pilot still living apparently unhurt plunged down eight thousand feet the sea The water geysered struck then closed over the spot and the gallant American youngster had become the first victim battle the monsters Moyen \\nVictim slender lancet what seemed golden lightning \\ncould have killed the pilot aloft there came quietly from Munson but chose pull his plane away from around him Their control the ray miraculous \\nthough confirm the statement Munson the leading aero sub struck again second plane The plane vanished but from the spot where had flown not even bit metal man sufficiently large seen the delicate recording instruments Maniel dropped out the sky \\nThe ray gold was ray oblivion the minions Moyen willed \\nCHAPTER VIII \\nCharmion \\nPrester Kleig came suddenly into the Secret Room the voice far distant Moyen you will once make change your rules regarding the admission other than Secret Agents the Secret Room You will once see that Charmion Kane sister your friend allowed enter \\nGod Almighty cry agony from the lips Prester Kleig had not forgotten Charmion but simply had had move swiftly that had put her out his mind For year had not seen her and hour two more could not matter greatly \\nAnd her brother Carlos went the voice see that too admitted wish for certain reasons that Charmion come unharmed through the direct attack about make against your country confess that save for this ability speak you unable work any damage the Secret Room which therefore the safest place for Charmion Kane Carlos Kane being spared because her brother \\nThere was mistaking the import this sinister command from Moyen had singled out Charmion the best beloved Prester Kleig for his attentions and that was sure the success his attack against the United Americas was proved the calm assurance his voice and the fact that concentrating the attack must still found time for thought Charmion Kane \\n \\nThe hand ice which had seldom been absent from the heart Kleig since had first seen and heard the voice Moyen gripped him anew Blood pounded maddeningly his temples Cold sweat bathed his body \\nBut the rest the Secret Agents save freeze into immobility when the hated voice spoke gave sign They had worries their own for instructions had been given that they bring their own loved ones into the sanctuary the Secret Room \\nthough answering the thoughts the others the hated voice spoke again \\nregret that cannot arrange for sanctuary for the loved ones all you for you are gallant antagonists why save the few when the many must perish For know you will not surrender however much have proved you that invincible But Charmion Kane must saved \\nGod whispered Kleig God \\nThen spoke General Munson \\nthink this ray which the Moyenites use variation the principle used the intricate machinery Professor Maniel though how they render visible not know But doesn matter and may only blind You note that when the black streak the golden ray strikes anything that thing instantly disintegrates certain pitch resonance will break pane glass matter vibration solely wherein the molecules composing any object animate inanimate are hurled all directions instantaneously \\nProfessor Maniel apparatus the Vibration Retarder able recapture the vibrations speeding outward endlessly through space and reconstruct and draw back visibility the objects destroyed this visible vibratory ray whatever This problem then falls into the province Professor Maniel \\n \\nThrough the heart and soul Prester Kleig there suddenly flowed great surge hope \\nGeneral Munson you will operate the machinery the Vibration Retarder wish talk with Professor Maniel \\nInstantly efficiently without word reply the eager command Prester Kleig General Munson relieved Professor Maniel the apparatus which Maniel called the Vibration Retarder his invention which had combined with audible teleview complete this visual miracle the Secret Room Professor Maniel stepped where Prester Kleig was sitting \\nPrester Kleig put fingers his lips for silence and expression surprise crossed the wrinkled dead white face the Professor \\nBefore Kleig could speak however there came signal from somewhere outside the Secret Room signal which said that the doors were being opened and that personage was coming The Secret Agents looked one another surprise for every man who had right inside the Secret Room was already present \\nknow said Kleig his face mask terror Charmion and Carlos Kane Moyen the devil has managed make sure obedience his orders \\nThe Secret Agents turned back the screen upon which the view the first aerial brush the American flyers with the minions Moyen their aero subs was drawing terrible close \\nFor the aero sub commanders had played with the warships which had human beings aboard them now did they play with the planes the Americas \\n \\nOne American flyer startled into frenzy the fate his fellows put his helicopter into action and leaped madly out the midst the battle Instantly aero sub zoomed skyward after him Again that golden streak light from the nose aero sub and the helicopter vanes and the slender staff upon whose tip they whirled vanished shorn short off above the vane grooves the top the wing \\nThe plane dropped away fluttering like falling leaf for moment before the aviator started his three propellers again \\ncheer broke from the lips Prester Kleig watched The commander that particular aero sub apparently contemptuous this flyer who had tried cut out the fight allowed him fall away unmolested and the American driven berserk the casual contemptuous treatment accorded him this strange enemy zoomed the second his propellers whirred into top speed action and raced the sky toward the belly the aero sub \\nonly the aero sub has blind spot cried Prester Kleig \\n \\nthat instant roaring crash sounded the Secret Room the American plane going full speed crashed propellers foremost into the belly the aero sub \\nAnd the aero sub whose brothers had seemed until this moment invincible did not escape the wrath the American though the American went into oblivion with \\nFor welded together American plane and aero sub started the eight thousand feet plunge downward the sea \\nWatch shrieked Munson Watch \\nthe aero sub and the plane plunged down through the formation fighters the aero sub pilots saw and they fled wild dismay and top speed from their falling compatriot Why For moment was not apparent And then was \\nFor out the body the doomed aero subs came sheets golden flame Not the flames fire but the golden sheen that streak which the aero subs had used against the American planes already out the fight The American flyer had crashed into the container whatever was that harnessed the agency through which the minions Moyen had destroyed the Stellar and the battleships raped from Hampton Roads \\nliquid then shrieked Munson \\nAnd seemed For second the golden mantle strange awe inspiring bathed and rendered invisible the aero sub and the plane which had slain her Then the golden flame vanished utterly instantly and the air where had been there was nothing The aero sub was gone and the plane whose mad charge had erased her \\nHer own death dealing agency destroyed her shrieked Munson And the other aero subs cut away from the fight save themselves because they too carry death and destruction within them \\n \\nThen the inner door the Secret Room opened and two people entered One them dazzling beauty with glorious black hair and the tread princess picture perfection from jeweled sandals coiffured hair was Charmion Kane Behind her came her brother whose face was chalky white But Charmion she crossed Kleig and kissed him while her eyes were luminous with love held her head proudly high imperious \\nknow she said softly Kleig and not afraid know you will prevent \\nKleig waved the two chairs and turned again Professor Maniel \\npiece paper wrote swiftly using mode shorthand known only the Secret Agents \\nProfessor wrote feverishly can you reverse the process used your Vibration Retarder Tell with your eyes for Moyen may even know this writing and sure hears what say here may even able see \\nProfessor Maniel started and stared deeply into the eyes Prester Kleig His face grew thoughtful brushed his slender hand over the massive dome his brow Hope burned high the heart Prester Kleig \\n \\nThen despite Kleig instructions answer merely the expression his eyes Professor Maniel leaned forward and wrote quickly the piece paper Kleig had used \\nTwo hours \\nNothing else explanations but Prester Kleig knew Maniel believed could but needed two hours which perfect his theory and make workable Kleig knew that had been able two years two decades still would have been the nature miracle \\nBut two hours \\nAnd Moyen had said that was preparing attack once \\ntwo hours Moyen unless the Americas fought against him with every resource their command could depopulate half the Western World Kleig looked back the screen \\nThere was not single American plane the sky above the graveyard those vanished warships And the aero subs swift flying the wind were racing back the mother ship scores miles away \\nMunson worked with the Vibration Retarder the Sound and Vision devices ranging the sea off the coast either side that huge suspended fortress which was the mother submarine the aero subs \\nGasps terror though the sight was not unexpected broke from the lips every person the Secret Room \\nFor super monsters Moyen were moving the attack \\nCHAPTER \\nFlowers Martyrdom \\nFor minute the Secret Agents were appalled the air might the deep sea monsters Moyen brought bodily almost into the Secret Room the activities General Munson the Sound and Vision apparatus \\nOff the coast miles away yet looming moment moment larger indicating the deceptively swift speed the monsters were scores the great under water fortresses traveling toward the coast the United Americas far flung formation each submarine separated from its neighbor right and left something like hundred miles easy cruising radius for the little aero subs carried inside the monsters \\nThat each submarine did carry such spawn Satan was plainly seen for the great submarines moved landward scores aero subs sported gleefully about the mother ships There was counting the number them \\nTwo hours Maniel needed for his labors which meant that for two hours the flower the country manhood must try hold check the mighty hordes Moyen \\nSomewhere there stated Prester Kleig one the other those monsters Moyen himself know that since wished Charmion saved for his attentions your work with your apparatus Munson while out the radio tower broadcast appeal for volunteers Charmion Carlos \\nBut Prester Kleig found that could not continue Not that was necessary for Charmion and Carlos knew what was his mind Charmion was lady vast intelligence from whom life little ironies had not been hidden and Kane and Kleig had already discussed the activities Moyen where women were concerned \\n \\nPrester Kleig hurried the Central Radio Tower and passed through each the many doors leading out the roof the new Capitol Building the guards the doors left form guard for him this moment the most precious man the country because knew best the terrible trials which faced her \\nThe country was turmoil seemed almost impossible that whole day had passed since Prester Kleig had returned and entered the Secret Room the meantime fleet battleships had been drawn some mysterious agency out sea from Hampton Roads and fleet fighting planes which had followed the ghost column outward had not returned \\nNews gatherers had spread the stories distorted and garbled across the western continents and throughout the western confederacy men women and children lived the throes the greatest fear that had ever gripped them Fear held them most because they could not give the cause their fear name save one \\nMoyen And the name was the lips everyone and frenzied woman stilled their squalling babes with its mention \\nword yet from the Secret Room but Prester Kleig had scarcely appeared from than someone started the radio signal which informed the frenzied waiting world the west that information exact startling would now forthcoming \\nmillions homes thousands high flying planes listeners tuned the clear all hum \\n \\nPrester Kleig wasted time preliminaries \\nPrester Kleig speaking are threatened Moyen with scores monster submarines each mother ship for scores aero subs combinations airplanes and miniature submarines They are moving our eastern coast from some secret base which have not yet located They are equipped with death dealing instruments which have but the most fragmentary knowledge and for two hours must call upon all flyers combat the menace until the Secret Agents especially Professor Maniel have had opportunity counteract the minions Moyen \\nFlyers the United Americas the name our country ask that volunteers gather the eastern coast each flyer proceeding once the nearest coast landing after dropping all passengers Your commanders have already been named your various organizations required franchise and orders for the movement the entire winged armada will come from this station However the orders will simply this Hold Moyen forces bay for period two hours And know that many you certain death and make your own decisions whether you shall volunteer \\nThis ended Prester Kleig excitement mounting high hurried back the Secret Room \\nNow the public knew and the American public given doing steadied down when knew the worst Fear the unknown had changed the public into myriad souled beast gone berserk Now that knowledge was exact men grew calm face determined and women assumed the supporting role which down the ages has been that brave women mothers men \\n \\nperiod silence for time after Prester Kleig pronouncement \\nentered the first door leading into the Secret Room Carlos Kane met and passed him with smile \\nYou called for winged volunteers did you not Kleig asked quietly \\nKleig nodded You are going said \\nYes duty \\nother words were necessary the men shook hands Prester Kleig going the Secret Room Carlos Kane going out join the mighty armada which must fight against the minions Moyen \\nThe words Prester Kleig were heard the pilots the sky lanes The passenger pits equipped with self opening parachutes which dropped jumpers series long falls order acquire swift but accurate and safe landing they opened intervals long falls two thousand feet stayed the fall then closed again that drops were almost continuous until the last four hundred feet and pilots swiftly making their minds dropped their passengers banked their planes and raced into the east \\n \\nAll over the Americas pilots dropped their passengers and their loads their franchises called for the carrying freight and banked about take part the first skirmish with the Moyenites \\nDropping figures almost darkened the sky passengers plunged downward after the startling signal from Washington Flowers which were the umbrellas chutes opened and closed like breathing winged orchids letting their burdens safely earth \\nAnd clouds and fleets airplanes came from all directions land rows and rows which were endless wing and wing along the eastern coast \\nPrester Kleig had scarcely entered the Secret Room than the hated voice Moyen again broke upon the ears the machinelike Secret Agents \\nThis madness gentlemen people will annihilate yours \\nBut since time for speech had passed not one the Secret Agents made answer paid the slightest heed the warning though deep the heart each and every one was the belief that Moyen spoke more than the truth \\nToo there was growing respect for the half god Asia that was good enough warn them the holocaust which faced their country \\nhundreds and thousands wing and wing airplanes dropped the Atlantic coast the closest point contact when the signal reached them high altitudes planes crossing the Atlantic turned back and returned top speed dropping their passengers soon over land That Moyen made move prevent the return flyers out over the ocean and now coming back was ominous circumstance \\nseemed show that held the American flyers all them utter contempt \\n \\nPrester Kleig regarded the time had been half hour since Moyen had spoken attack half hour since the monsters the deep had started the inexorable move toward land the screen the submarines were bulking larger and larger the moments fled until seemed the Secret Agents that the great composite shadow them already was sweeping inland from the coast \\nthe coast came close ahead the monster subs the little aero subs the surprise the Secret Agents all vanished into their respective mother ships \\nBut they have use them groaned Munson For their submarines are useless frontal attack against our shores \\nnot sure that said Prester Kleig For have suspicion that those submarines have tractors under their keels and that they can come out land this the monsters can guarded armour plate penetrate the very heart our most populated areas before their aero subs are released \\nNone the Secret Agents yet had stopped ponder how the monsters had reached their positions and why Moyen was attacking from the east when the Pacific side the continents would have appeared the obvious point attack and would have obviated the necessity long secret under sea journeys wherein discovery prematurely must have been one the many worries the submarine commanders \\nThe mere fact the presence the monsters was enough What had preceded their presence was unimportant save that their presence and their near approach the shore undetected further proved the executive and planning genius Moyen \\nTwo miles average off the eastern coast the submarines laid their eggs the aero subs which darted from the sides the mother ships flights and squadrons made the surface and leaped into the sky \\nFive minutes later and the signal went forth the phalanx the volunteers \\nTake off Fly east and engage the enemy and hold him check and the God our fathers with you \\nOne hour had passed since Moyen ultimatum when the first vanguard the American flyers obeying the peremptory signal took the air and darted eastward meet the winged death harbingers Moyen \\nCHAPTER \\nThey Shall Not Pass \\nPrester Kleig heartfelt desire the American flyers closed with the first the aero subs was out with them and aid them the attack against the Moyenites But knew and was tacit thing that best served his country from the safe haven the Secret Room \\nwatched the scenes unfold the screen Maniel genius with occasional glances the somewhat mysterious but profound and concentrated labors Maniel Charmion Kane rose from her place and came his side \\nWide eyed she watched the joining battle she stood there her tiny hand encased the tense one Prester Kleig \\nYou would like out there she murmured know But your country needs you here and have already given Carlos \\nPrester Kleig tightened his grip her hand \\n \\nThere was deep silent understanding between these two and Prester Kleig fighting against the Moyenites realized even above his realization that his labors were primarily for the benefit his country that really matched wits with Moyen for the sake Charmion Had anyone asked him whether would have sacrificed her for the benefit his country would have been difficult question answer \\nwas glad that the question was never asked \\nYes beloved whispered would like out there but the greatest need for here \\nBut even felt though was betraying those intrepid flyers was sending sure death Yet they had volunteered and was the only way \\nManiel gnomelike little man with Titan brain labored with his calculations made swiftly concrete his theories while the Sound and Vision apparatus excitable General Munson ranged the aerial battlefield see how the tide battle ebbed and flowed \\nThat neither side would either ask give quarter was instantly apparent for they rushed head meet each other those vast opposing winged armadas top speed and not single individual swerved from his course though least the Americans knew that death rode the skyways ahead \\nThen \\nThe battle was joined Moyen forces were superior armament Their sky steeds were faster more readily maneuverable though the flying forces the Americas the last five years had made vast strides aviation But what the Americans lacked power they made for fearless courage \\n \\nThe plan battle seemed automatically work itself out \\nThe first vanguard American planes came into contact with the forces Moyen and from the noses countless aero subs spurted that golden streak which the Secret Agents knew and dreaded \\nThe first flight planes stretching from horizon horizon vanished from the sky with that dreadful surety which had marked the passing the Stellar and such those warships had felt the full force the visible ray \\nFrom General Munson rose groan anguish These convertible fighting planes had been the pride the heart the old warrior him credit however was the wanton terribly inevitable destruction the flyers themselves which affected him was final absolute and utterly impossible combat \\nWait snapped Prester Kleig \\nFor the intrepid flyers behind that vanguard which had vanished had witnessed the wholesale disintegration the leading element the vast armada and the pilots realized the instant that headlong rush into the very noses the aero subs would avail anything \\nThe vast American formation broke into mad maelstrom whirling darting diving planes Every third plane plummeted downward every second one climbed and the remaining ships even the face what had happened the vanished first flight held steadily the front \\nthis mad seemingly meaningless formation they closed the aero subs Without having seen the fight the Americans were aping the action that one nameless flyer who had charged the aero sub that had been destroyed \\n \\nKleig remembered score ships had been destroyed utterly above the graveyard dreadnoughts yet only one aero sub and that quite chance had been marked off the casualty column \\nDeath rode the heavens the American flyers went into action For head fights flyers went top speed their planes whirling the axes fuselages all guns going Planes were armored against their own bullets and they were not under the necessity watching see that they did not slay their own friends \\nEven bullets were rather ineffective against the aero subs whose apparently flimsy almost transparent outer covering diverted the bullets with amazing ease \\nwhirling maelstrom ships The monsters Moyen had drawn first blood the expression may used action where blood all was drawn but machines and men simply erased from existence \\nHundreds planes already gone when the second flight ships closed with the aero subs Yellow streaks death flashed from aero sub nostrils but even aero sub operators set their rays into motion the American flyers head charge rolled dived zoomed and kept their guns going \\nHigh above the first flight aero subs behind which another flight was winging swiftly into action American flyers tilted the noses their planes over and dived under full power sure death suicide though none knew there the moment \\n \\nThese aero subs could not driven from the sky usual means and could destroy American ships even before those planes could come handgrips but they the flyers plainly believed could crashed out the sky and never guessing what besides death resulting crashes they faced the flyers above the aero subs even aero subs rear flashed prevent dived down straight the backs the aero subs \\nhundred places the dives the Americans worked successfully and American planes crashed full and true full power into the backs the flying fish some aero subs the container the Moyen dealing agency apparently remained untouched and airplanes and aero subs welded together plunged down the invisible skylanes into the sea \\nUnder water some the aero subs were seen keep motion limping toward the nearest mother submarines \\nhope said Prester Kleig the American flyers such cases are already dead for Moyen will maniac his tortures Munson you hurriedly examine the mother subs and see you can locate Moyen \\n \\nHowever only scattered aero sub here and there went down without the strange substance the yellow ray being released most cases upon the contact plane with aero sub the aero subs and planes were instantly blotted from view the yellow golden flames from the heart the winged harbingers Moyen \\nGolden flames blinding their brightness dropping down mere shapeless blotches then fading out nothingness matter seconds with aero sub and airplane totally erased from action and from existence \\nThe American flyers saw and knew now the manner death they faced Yet all along the battle front not American tried evade the issue and draw out the fight sublime inspiring exhibition mass courage which had not been witnessed down the years since that general engagement which men the time had called the Great War \\nPrester Kleig turned look Maniel Drops perspiration bathed the cheeks the master scientist but his eyes were glowing like coals fire His face was set white mask concentration and Prester Kleig knew that Maniel would find the answer the thing sought such answer could found \\nWould the American flyers able hold off the minions Moyen until Maniel was ready The fight out there above the waters was terrible thing and the Americans fought and died like men inspired yet inexorably the winged armada Moyen preceded those licking golden tongues was moving landward \\nGreat God cried Munson Look \\n \\nThere was really need for the order for every Secret Agent saw soon did Munson Under the sea just off the coast the mother subs had touched their blunt nose against the upward shelving the sea bottom had touched bottom and were slowly but surely following the underwater curve the land toward the surface like unbelievable antediluvian monsters out some nightmare \\nYes said Kleig quietly those monsters Moyen can move land and the aero subs can operate from them easily land under water \\nKleig regarded the time whirled look Professor Maniel \\nOne hour and forty minutes had passed since Maniel had begged for two hours which prepare some mode effectively combatting the might Moyen Twenty minutes yet the mother subs would ashore dragging their sweating monstrous sides out the deep within ten minutes \\nTen minutes ashore and there was guessing the havoc they could cause the United Americas \\nHurry Maniel Hurry Hurry said Prester Kleig \\nBut spoke the words himself though even had spoken them aloud Maniel would not have heard For Maniel for two hours had closed his mind everything that transpired outside his own thoughts devoted foiling the power Moyen \\nfound him snapped Munson \\n \\npointed with shaking forefinger one the mother subs crawling the slant the ocean bed twisted one the little nubs the Sound and Vision apparatus and the angelic face and Satanic eyes the twisted body Moyen came into view \\nThe face was calm with dreadful purpose and Moyen stood the heart one his monsters his eyes turned toward the land With gasp terror dreadfully afraid for the first time Prester Kleig turned and looked into the eyes Charmion \\nshe said will never happen have faith you \\nThere were still ten minutes the two hours left when the mother subs broke water and started crawling inland swiftly surely without faltering the slightest they changed their element from water land \\nthough their appearance had been the signal the aero subs action against the first line American planes broke out the one sided fight and dived for their mother ships while mere handful the American planes started back for home prepare anew continue the struggle \\nPrester Kleig gave the signal the second monster armada which had remained reserve \\neverything your power halt the march Moyen amphibians \\nTen minutes and Professor Maniel still labored like Titan \\nCHAPTER \\nCaucasia Falls Silent \\nthe scores amphibian monsters came lumbering forth upon dry land became instantly apparent why the aero subs had returned the mother ships For few moments out the water the amphibians were almost helpless with practically way attack defense helpless huge turtles turned legs \\nBut each aero sub entered its proper slot the side the mother amphibian was turned about and the nose thrust back into the opening which closed down fit tightly about the nose the aero sub that those flame breathing monsters protruded from the sides the amphibians many places transforming the amphibians into monsters with hundreds golden licking tongues \\nwith each and every aero sub place the amphibians started moving inland Professor Maniel made his first move With the tiny apparatus upon which had been working stepped the table before the Sound and Vision apparatus and spoke softly his compatriots \\nGentlemen said have finished and will work effectively \\nThough Maniel spoke softly was plain seen that was proud his accomplishment which remained only attached start performance \\nmatter seconds \\nYet during those seconds was the real might the real power for utter devastation Moyen fully exposed \\n \\nThe amphibians got under way the airplanes the Americas swept into the fight \\nFrom the sides the monsters licked out those golden tongues flame and from the front \\nHalf dozen amphibians slipped into New York from the harbor side and started into the heart the city And between the time when Maniel had said was ready and the moment when made his first active move against Moyen half dozen skyscrapers vanished into nothingness the spots where they had stood swept clear debris though the land had never been reclaimed from Nature \\nNone was ever destined know how many lives were lost that first attack the monsters the golden myriad tongues but the monsters struck the midst working day when the skyscrapers were filled with office workers \\nAnd resolve struck deep into the hearts the Secret Agents Moyen were turned back must made pay for the slaughter \\nmatter seconds \\n \\nThen moment deathly silence Munson gave way the screen for the gnomelike little Professor Maniel \\nNow gentlemen snapped Maniel theory correct manipulating instruments with lightning speed talked the reversion the principle Vibration Retarder which captures vibrations speeding outward from the earth and transforms them once again into sound and pictures audible and visible the human ear this apparatus will disintegrate the monsters our boats and planes were disintegrated \\nthis have even been compelled manipulate the matter time must not only defeat and annihilate the minions Moyen but must work from mathematical absurdity that the moment impact that moment itself must become part the past sufficiently remote remove the monsters such distance from the earth that not even the mighty genius Moyen can return them \\nThe whirring gentle the whirring doves wings the center the picture the screen were those half dozen amphibians laying waste Manhattan Maniel set his intricate delicate machinery into motion \\nInstantly the amphibians there seemed become misty shadowy and lift out Manhattan above the roof tops skyscrapers still remaining nebulous and wraithlike ghost shrouds yet swinging outward from the earth with speed almost too swift for the eye detect \\nBut where the amphibians had rested there stood reclined all sorts postures surprising and even bit ridiculous the men Moyen who had operated the monsters Moyen \\n \\nFrom the Central Radio tower went forth mighty voice command the planes which had been engaging the aero subs off the coast \\nSlay Slay \\nDown flashed the planes the Americas and their guns were blazing inaudibly but none the less deadly aim and purpose straight into the midst the men Moyen who had thus been left marooned and almost helpless with the vanishing their amphibians \\nAnd noting how they fell strangled huddled heaps before the vengeful fire the American planes the Secret Agents sighed and Maniel his face alight with the pride accomplishment switched another point along the coast \\nAnd new group the monsters Moyen came into view and Maniel bent his labors afresh the hated voice the master mobster broke once more the Secret Room \\nEnough Kleig Enough will surrender save lives stipulate only that own life spared \\nwhich Prester Kleig made instant reply \\nDid you offer choice surrender Did you spare the lives our people which with your control your golden rays you could easily have done  Nor will spare lives least all the life Moyen \\nThe whirring again the whirring doves wings More metal monsters even golden tongues spewed forth from their many sides vanished from view leaping skyward while the operators them were left the mercies the remaining airmen the Americans \\n \\nVoicelessly the word went forth \\nSlay Slay \\nwas Charmion who begged for mercy for the vanquished one one surely fate the monsters with their contained aero subs were blotted out leaving pilots and operators behind them Down upon these dropped the airmen the West slaying without mercy \\nPlease lover Charmion whispered Spare them \\nEven began thinking Moyen who would have taken Charmion felt her shudder she read his mind understood what would have asked \\nThere came softly from Munson \\namphibian had just been disintegrated had just climbed mistily swiftly into invisibility the skies And there the midst the conquerors left behind his angel face set moody mask his pale eyes awful with fear his misshapen body sagging terrible its realization failure was Moyen \\nEven Kleig prepared give the mercy signal plane dived down the group about Moyen and the Secret Agents could see the hand the pilot lifted high though signaled \\nThe plane was Mayther The pilot was Carlos Kane \\n \\nJust Kane went into action and the noiseless bullets from his ship crashed into that twisted body causing jump and twitch with the might them Prester Kleig gave the signal \\nEven the figure Moyen crashed the soil and the man soul quitted its mortal casement Kleig commanded \\nSpare all who surrender Make them prisoners used repair the damage they have done our country Guards will instantly placed over the amphibians and the aero subs for the day may come when shall need know their secrets \\nAnd men hands lifted high token surrender quitted the now motionless amphibians and flyers dropped down make them prisoners Maniel sighed pressed various buttons his apparatus and the mad scene carnage they had witnessed for hours faded slowly out and darkness and silence filled the Secret Room \\nBut darkness the joy lovers and the midst silence that was almost appalling contrast Kleig and Charmion were received into each other arms

hours repeating the address over and over again When was satisfied that had memorized thoroughly tore the strange paper into bits and sent fluttering earthward like tiny snowstorm \\nLarner was not

fishing grounds has its seat the old mining camp Leadville has been visited and settled more for its gold mines than the golden glow its sunsets above the clouds but the gold the sunsets eternal while the gold the mines fading quickly away \\nLeadville with its 000 inhabitants nestles above the clouds altitude more than 000 feet Mount Massive with its three peaks lies back the town panorama and rises height some 400 feet the rugged mountains thereabouts are hundreds lakes fed wild streams and bubbling crystal springs All these lakes are above the clouds \\nWinter sees the whole picture decorated with bizarre snowdrifts from twenty forty feet deep but spring comes early The beautiful columbines and crocuses bloom before the snow all off the ground the valleys The lands 000 feet

\\nany direction near Leadville man can find Heaven and recreation and rest \\nFinding himself Harrison Avenue the main street the county seat Larner after renewing some old acquaintanceships started

walked along beside \\n \\nThe first day fishing was good Trout seemed greet him cheerily and sprang eagerly the fray They bit any sort silken fly cast \\nThe site chosen Larner for his camp was mossy clearing separated from the stream fringe willows along the creek Then came border aspens backed forest silver tipped firs \\nwas ideal and his eyes swept the scene with satisfaction Then began whittling bacon grease his pan for frying trout over the open fire \\nSuddenly heard rustle the aspens and looking beheld picture which made his eyes bulge man and woman garbed seemingly the costumes another world walked toward him Neither were more than five feet tall but were physically perfect and marvelously pleasing the eye There was little difference their dress \\nBoth wore helmets studded with what Larner believed sapphires learned later they were diamonds Their clothing consisted tight trouserlike garments surmounted tunics some white pelt resembling chamois save for color belt studded with precious stones encircled their waists Artistic laced sandals graced their small firm feet \\nTheir skin was pinkish white Their every feature was perfection plus and their bodies curved just enough wherever curve should The woman was daintier and more fully developed and her features were even more finely chiseled than the man Otherwise would have been difficult distinguish their sex \\nLarner took these details subconsciously for was awed beyond expression All could was stand seemingly frozen half bent over the campfire with his frying pan his hand \\n \\nThe man spoke \\nhope did not startle you said thought note would partly prepare you for this meeting expected find you the Frying Pan district When you did not appear there tuned our radio locator your heart beats and that way located you here was hardly second space flying time from where were \\nLarner said nothing could only stand and gape \\nnot wonder that you are surprised said the strange little man will explain that Nern Bela the City Hesper the planet Venus This sister Tula greet you the interest the Republic Pana which embraces all the planet you know Venus \\nWhen Larner recovered his breath lost his temper \\ndon know what circus you escaped from but crave solitude and have time bothered with fairy tales said with brutal bruskness \\nExpressions hurt surprise swept the countenances his visitors \\nThe man spoke again \\nare just what assert are and our finding you was made necessary condition which grieves the souls all the 900 000 000 inhabitants Venus have come plead with you come with and use your scientific knowledge thwart scourge which threatens the lives millions people \\nThere was quiet dignity about the man and air pride about the woman which made Larner stop and think try rubbed his hand over his brow and looked questioningly the pair \\nyou are what you say you are how did you get here asked \\ncame targo space flying ship capable doing 426 000 miles hour This just 1200 times fast 355 miles hour the highest speed known earth Come with and will show you our ship They looked him appealingly and both smiled smile wistful friendliness \\nLarner without word threw down his frying pan and followed them through the aspens The brother and sister walking ahead him gave his eyes treat surveyed the perfect form the girl Her perfection was beyond his ken \\nThey certainly are not this world mused \\n \\nfew hundred yards farther there was beach pebbles where the stream had changed its course this plot sat gigantic spherical machine glasslike material was about 300 feet diameter and was tapered two sides into tees which Larner rightly took lights \\nThis targo our type space flyer said Nern Bela capable making two trips year between Venus and the earth have visited this planet often always landing some mountain jungle fastness heretofore did not desire earth dwellers know our presence \\nWhy not asked Larner his mouth agape and his eyes protruding His mind was full questions that fairly blurted his first one \\nBecause said Bela slowly and frankly because our race knows sickness and feared contagion your race has not yet learned control its being \\nsaid Lamer thoughtfully realized that humans the earth whom had always regarded God most perfect beings were not perfect after all \\nHow you people control your being you express asked \\nsimple was the reply For ninety centuries have ceased breed imperfection crime and disease deprived one the pleasures life but only the most perfect mental and physical specimens our people cared have children other words while make claim controlling our sex habits control results \\nsaid Larner again \\nNern Bela led the way door which opened into the side the space flyer near its base have crew four men and four women said They handle the entire ship with sister and command making six souls aboard all \\nWhy men and women thought Larner \\nanswer his thought Bela said \\nthe earth the two sexes have struggled for sex supremacy This has thrown your civilization out balance Venus have struggled for sex equality and have accomplished This perfect balance Man and women engage all endeavor and share all favors and rewards alike \\nwar too asked Larner \\nThere has not been war Venus for 600 000 years said Bela There only the one nation and the people all live perfect accord Our only trouble centuries dire peril which now threatens our people and this that wish talk you more length \\n \\nThey were standing close the targo Larner was struck the peculiar material which was constructed There was question his eyes and Nern Bela answered \\nThe metal duranium metalized quartz frictionless conducts current ray except repulsion and attraction ray NTR69X6 which propelled practically transparent lighter than air and harder than diamond cast moulds after being melted rather fused \\nuse cold light which produce forcing oxygen through air tubes into vat filled with the fat deep sea fish resembling your whale You are aware course that that exactly how cold light produced the firefly except for the fact that the firefly uses his own fat \\nLarner was positively fascinated smoothed the metal the targo appreciation its marvelous construction but longed most see the curious light giving mechanism for this was closer his own line entomology had always believed that the light giving organs fireflys and deep sea fishes could reproduced mechanically \\nThe interior the ship resembled vague way that ocean liner was controlled instrument board which man and girl sat They did not raise their heads the three people entered \\nWhen called Bela and his sister who seemed give commands unison the crew assembled and were presented the visitor \\nEarth dwellers are not the curiosity that seem you said Tula Bela speaking for the first time and smiling sweetly \\nLarner was too engrossed note the remark further than nod his head was lost contemplation these strange people all garbed exactly alike and all surpassingly lovely look upon \\n \\nodor food wafted from the galley and Larner remembered was hungry with the hunger health had swung his basket fish over his shoulder when left his campfire and Tula took from him \\nWould you like have our chef prepare them for you she said she caught his hungry glance his day catch This time Larner answered her \\nyou will pardon said awkwardly Really famished \\nYou will not miss your fish dinner said the girl \\nbelieve there enough for all said Larner caught twenty beauties never knew fish bite like that Why they and was off voluminous discourse favorite subject \\nThose assembled listened sympathetically Then Tula took the fish and soon the aroma broiling trout mingled with the other entrancing galley odors \\nAfter dinner which some weird yet satisfying viands were served and much unusual conversation indulged Nern Bela led the way what appeared the captain quarters The crew and their visitor sat down discuss subject which proved such terrifying nature scar human souls \\nPeople Venus said Nern his eyes took worried expression are unable leave their homes after nightfall due some strange nocturnal beast which attacks them and vampirishly drains all blood from their veins leaving the dead bodies limp and empty \\nWhat How questioned Larner leaning far forward over the conference table \\nThe others nodded their heads and the eyes the women there was terror Larner could not but believe this \\nThe beasts should say insects are large your horses and they fly actually fly night striking down humans domestic animals and all creatures warm blood How many there are have means knowing and cannot find their hiding and breeding places They are not native our planet and where they come from cannot imagine They are actually monstrous flys bugs some form insects \\n \\nLarner was overcome incredulity and showed Insects big horses questioned and could hardly suppress smile \\nBelieve the name the God all insisted Nern They have mouth which consists large suction disk the center which lancelike tongue The lance forced into the body any convenient point and the suction disk drains out the blood only knew their source They attack young children and the aged five hundred years alike \\nWhat Five hundred years exploded Larner again \\nshould have explained said Nern simply that Venus dwellers due our advanced knowledge sanitation and health conversation live about 800 years and then die invariably old age The only unnatural cause death encountered this giant insect Accidents occur but they are rare There are deliberate killings Venus \\nLarner did not answer only pondered The more ran over the strange happenings the last week his mind the more believed was dreaming His thoughts took strange turn Why these vain people around dressed jeweled ornaments \\nNern again anticipated question Diamonds gold and many what you call precious stones are common Venus volunteered Talc and many other things are more valuable \\nTalc \\nYes use immense quantity have wood that harder than your steel build machinery with cannot use oil lubricate these wooden shafts and bearings softens the wood all parts exposed friction are sprayed constantly gust talc from blower \\nYou use talc mostly for toilet purposes use for various purposes There little left Venus and more valuable than either gold diamonds draw your planet now for talc You dump immense quantities just shipped one hundred 000 ton globes from the Cripple Creek district and the district never missed drew most from your mine dumps \\n \\nNern tried not look bored explained more detail brought 100 hollow spheres constructed duranium suspended these over the Cripple Creek district altitude 000 feet above the earth surface Because the crystal glint duranium they were invisible earth dwellers that height Then used suction draft night drawing the talc from the earth filling one drum after another This done tuning certain selective attraction that attracts only talc draws right out your ground tiny particles and assembles the transportation drums pure talc the earth noticed all would have been called dust storm \\nThe drums when loaded with talc are set attract the proper planetary force and they speeding toward Venus the rate 426 000 miles hour They are prevented from colliding with meteors automatic magnetic device This controlled magnetic force alone and when the targo gets too close meteor changes its course instantly The passenger targo ride acts similarly And now may return the subject the vampires Venus \\nPardon ignorance said Larner and for the first time his life felt very ignorant indeed \\nknow little more than have told you said Nern rather hopelessly Our knowledge your world your people and your language comes from our listening you and observing you without being observed heard This might seem like taking advantage you were not for the fact that respect confidences and subjugate all else science have helped you times telepathically suggesting ideas your thinkers \\nwould have given you all our inventions this way gladly but many instances were unable find minds attuned accept such advanced ideas have had the advantage you because our planet many millions years older than your own There was plaintive note Nern voice talked \\n \\nBut now are our knees you speak not know everything and desperately need the aid man your caliber behalf the distraught people Venus asking you bluntly make great sacrifice Will you face the dangers trip Venus and use your knowledge aid exterminating these creatures hell There was positive pleading his voice and the eyes his beautiful sister there were tears \\nBut what would superiors the Government Bureau think feebly protested Larner could not explain \\nYou have superiors your line Our Government needs you this time more than any earthly government Your place here fixture You can always return should you live are asking you face horrible death with You can name your own compensation but know you are not interested much reward \\nNow honestly good professor there advantage gained explanation Just disappear the name God and the interests science and the salvation people who are your mercy just drop out sight Drop out life this planet Come with The cause worthy the man believe you \\nwill said Larner and his hosts waited for more instant later the targo shot out into interstellar space \\nHow you know what course follow asked Larner after reasonable time when had recovered from his surprise the sudden take off \\nnot need know Our machine tuned attracted the planetary force Venus alone could not elsewhere repulsion ray finds near Venus and protects against too violent landing will land Venus like feather about three months from night \\nThe time the journey through outer space was little moment save for one incident Larner and the other travelers were suddenly and rather rudely jostled about the rapidly flying craft \\nLarner lost his breath but not his speech What happened inquired \\njust automatically dodged meteor explained Nern \\n \\nMost the time the trip was spent Larner listening explanations customs and traditions the people the brightest planet the universe \\nThere was question Larner had desired ask Nern Bela yet hesitated Finally one evening during the journey Venus when the travelers had been occupying themselves scientific discussion comparative evolution the two planets Larner saw his opportunity \\nWhy asked rather hesitatingly did the people Venus always remain small Why did you not strive more for height The Japanese who are the shortest stature earth people always wanted tall \\nWithout meaning any offense replied Nern must say that characteristic earth dwellers want something without knowing any good reason why they want perfectly all right for you people tall but for not fitting You see Venus smaller than the earth Size comparative You think are not tall because you are used taller people Comparatively are tall enough proportion the size our planet are exactly the right size keep our population 900 000 000 and that the perfectly exact number people who can live comfortably our planet \\n \\nArriving Venus Larner was assigned laboratory and office one the Government buildings was world seemingly made glass Quartz rose white and crystal coloring Larner found was the commonest country rock the planet many cases was shot full splinters gold which the natives had not taken the trouble recover This quartz was terrific hardness and was used building paving and public works generally The effect was bewildering was world shimmering crystal \\nThe atmosphere Venus had long puzzled Larner While not astronomer the largest sense the word yet had keen interest the heavens giant puzzle picture and had given some spare time the study \\nknew that from all indications Venus had most unusual atmosphere had read that the atmosphere was considerably denser than that the earth and that its presence made observation difficult The actual surface the planet knew could hardly seen due either this atmosphere seemingly perpetual cloud banks \\nhad read that the presence atmosphere surrounding Venus indicated earthly astronomers during the planet transit rings light due the reflection and scattering collected sunlight its atmosphere \\nAstronomers earth knew had long been satisfied the presence great cloud banks rocks and soils could not have such high reflecting power knew that like the moon Venus when viewed from the earth presents different phases from the crescent the full total stage \\nLooking the sky from the quartz streets Venus Larner beheld sweeping grandeur massed cloud banks many them apparently rain clouds \\nNern noted his skyward gaze and said \\nhave accomplished meteorological control Those clouds were brought under control when conquered interplanetary force and what you call gravity form them and move them will They are our rain factory make rain when and where will This insures our crops and makes for health and contentment \\nThe air you will note about the same little more moist than the earth air sea level This due the planet position nearer the sun \\nhave been striving for centuries make the air little drier and more rare but have not succeeded yet The heavy content disintegrated quartz our soil makes moisture very necessary for our crops our moist atmosphere evidently provision providence are used breathing this moist air and when first visited the earth was made uncomfortable your rarified atmosphere Now can adjust myself breathing the air either planet However find myself drinking great deal more water earth than Venus \\n \\nthis fairyland which had enjoyed centuries peace health and accord stark terror now reigned some instances the finely bred marvellously intelligent people were mental condition bordering madness \\nThis was especially true the farming districts where whole herds lats had been wiped out Lats Larner gleaned were common farm animal similar the bovine species earth only more wooly these creatures the Venus dwellers depended for their milk and dairy supplies and for their warmer clothing which was made from the skin The hair was used for brushes the building trades and thousand ways manufacturing \\nBesides the domestic animals hundreds people continued meet death and only few the flying vampires had been hunted down The giant insects were believed breed slowly compared earth insects their females producing not more than ten eggs estimate after which death overtook the adult spite this they were reported increasing \\nthe Government building Larner was placed touch with all the Government scientists Venus His nearest collaborator was one Zorn Zada most profound scientist the planet The two men with score assistants worked elbow elbow the most gigantic scientific mystery the history two planets \\nspecimen the dread invader was mounted and studied the scientists who were engrossed their work that they hardly took time eat for sleep there was little Days were spent research and nights hunting the monsters This hunting was done newly recruited soldiers and scientists The weapons used were short ray gun high destructive power which disintegrated the bodies the enemies atomic energy blasts The quarry was wary however and struck isolated individuals rather than massed fighting lines \\n \\nSeated his work bench Larner asked Zorn Zada what had become Nern Bela his heart had horrible lurking fear that the beautiful Tula Bela might fall before swarm the strange vampires but did not voice this anxiety \\nNern and his sister are explorers and navigators was the reply They have been assigned carry you anywhere this any other planet where your work may engage you They await your orders They are too valuable space navigators placed harm way \\nBreathing sigh relief Larner bent his labors \\nWhat other wild animals harmful insects have you this planet asked Zorn \\nget your thought replied the first scientist Venus You are seeking natural enemy this deadly flying menace are you not \\nYes admitted Larner \\nAll insects left Venus with this one exception are beneficial said Zorn There are wild animals and harmful insects All animals insects and birds have been domesticated and are fed their keepers get fabrics from forms what you call spiders and other web builders and cocoon spinners All forms birds beasts and crawling and flying things have been brought under the dominion man will have seek another way out than finding enemy parasite \\nWhere you think these insect invaders came from asked Larner \\nYou have noticed they are unlike anything you have earth anatomical construction said the savant They partake the general features Coleoptera beetles that they wear sheath armor yet their mouth parts are more the order the Diptera flys regard them more fly than beetle because most Coleoptera are helpful humanity while practically all not all Diptera are malignant \\ntheir original habitat believe they migrated here from some other planet \\nThey could not fly through space said Larner \\nthat the mystery agreed Zorn How they got here and where they breed are the questions that have answer \\n \\nLong days passed Venus Long days and sleepless nights The big insects were hunted nightly men armed with ray guns and nightly the blood sucking monsters took their toll humanity and animals \\nFinally Larner and Zorn determined capture one the insects alive muzzle its lance and suction pad and give sufficient freedom find its way back its hiding place following the shackled monster the scientists hoped find the breeding grounds \\nAll the provinces the planet joined the drive Men turned out automatic vehicles propelled energy gathered from the atmosphere They came foot and aircraft Mobilization was given points and leading the van were Zorn and Larner and their confreres the targo Nern and Tula Bela The great army Venus carried giant searchlights and was armed with deadly ray guns \\n \\nHeadquarters the vast Army Offense was the targo the Belas Larner was supreme command Just before the big army set out scour the planet seek the breeding place the monsters Larner issued bulletin that set all Venus the ears \\nAddressed President Vole Vesta the Republic Pana and the good people Venus read \\ngenerally known has been the habit the nation space flying merchantmen visit the sunlit side the planet Mercury obtain certain rare woods and other materials not found this planet \\nOne side Mercury known always turned from the sun and condition perpetual night this perpetual darkness and dampness where many rivers flow into warm black swamps the vampires have bred for centuries Conditions were ideal for their growth and through the ages they evolved into the monsters have encountered lately Venus \\nDuring some comparatively recent visit Mercury the grubs these insects have found their way abroad vegetation laden targo left standing near the edge the black swamps Mercury These grubs were thus transported Venus and underwent their natural metamorphosis here Reaching adult stage they have found some place hide and breed and thus explained the origin the vampires Venus \\nThis was widely read and discussed and was finally accepted the means the invasion peaceful beautiful Venus horror that might well have originated hell \\nHowever this did not reveal the breeding grounds remove the nation wide scourge the horrible winged vampires the mobilization all the forces the planet continued \\n \\nday followed day the hordes fighting Venus dwellers grew the concentration camps the targo the Belas Larner brain weary and body racked was with overwork found grain happiness being the presence Nern and his beautiful petite sister \\nWith Zorn Larner was supervising the construction big net strongly woven wire mesh which was hoped catch one the vampires was decided bait the trap with fat female lat \\nZorn Larner and the Belas fared forth from the concentration camp followed company soldiers carrying the big net Tula with her own hand led the fat lat heifer His eyes were filled with commiseration for the poor animal \\nThousands soldiers and citizenry fighting array watched the departure the little group \\nglade the trap was set and the net arranged fall over the monster once attacked the calf From thicket utter darkness Zorn and Larner and the two Belas waited for the possible catch The whole nation stood awaiting the order advance \\nthe fourth night the vigil was rewarded manner frightful relate \\nclumsy flutter giant wings broke the stillness \\nThe four waiting forms the thicket rejoiced believing the fat lat was about attacked \\nOnward came the approaching horror The measured flap flap its armored wings drawing nearer and nearer Then horror horrors \\nfeminine scream rent the air Cries loud and shrill arose above hysterical feminine cry for help \\nThe monster had chosen Tula Bela for its prey \\n \\nZorn exploded alarm bomb compressed air siren brought the army forward the run Giant floodlights began light the scene The blood Larner and Nern froze \\nThe monster had borne the girl the ground Its frightful lance and cupper was upraised strike Larner was the nearest and the quickest act grabbed for his ray gun swung his belt was gone horror remembered had left the base seized short knife and threw himself forward rolling his body between that the girl and the descending lance and cupper \\nthe lance pierced his shoulder Larner one wild gesture frenzy drove his knife through the soft yielding flesh the vampire organ suction \\nProtected bony structure the snout the monster was amputated \\nThe terrible creature had been disarmed his most formidable weapon but continued fight Larner felt the spikes the monster legs tear his flesh \\nDon kill the thing shouted Bring the net For the love God bring the net Then lost consciousness \\nwas daylight when Larner somewhat weakened from loss blood regained consciousness \\nThe beautiful Tula Bela was leaning over him \\nShe whispered comforting words him language did not fully understand She whispered happy exclamations words did not know the meaning but the tone was unmistakably those sweetheart towards her lover \\nFinally answer true scientist question his eyes she said English \\nThey caught the thing alive They await your order advance \\nLet our way said Larner and started arise \\nYou are hardly strong enough said Tula \\nBelieve all right insisted Larner and after several trials got his feet His constitution was naturally strong and his will was stronger fought back all feelings weakness and soon announced himself ready ahead with the project hand For speed was all important and the young professor found himself unable remain inactive \\n \\nrejoiced when Zorn told him that the big insect that had attacked Tula Bela had been captured alive and had been kept well nourished lat blood injected into its stomach \\nWith Zorn Larner went

the most significant far aviation history was the blind flight Lieut James Doolittle daredevil the Army Air Corps Mitchel Field which led Harry Guggenheim President the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion Aeronautics Inc announce that the problem fog flying one aviation greatest bugbears had been solved last \\nThere has been blind flying done the past but never before the history aviation has any pilot taken off circled crossed crossed the field then landed only short distance away from his starting point while flying under conditions resembling the densest fog Lieut Jimmy Doolittle has done his Wright motored Husky training plane was something uncanny contemplate \\nThe dense fog was produced artificially the simple device making the cabin the plane entirely light proof Once seated inside the flyer with his pilot Lieut Benjamin Kelsey also Mitchel Field were completely shut off from any view the world outside All they had depend were three new flying instruments developed during the past year experiments conducted over the full flight laboratory established the Fund Mitchel Field \\nThe chief factors contributing the solution the problem blind flying consist new application the visual radio beacon the development improved instrument for indicating the longitudinal and lateral position airplane new directional gyroscope and sensitive barometric altimeter delicate measure the altitude airplane within few feet the ground \\nThus instead relying the natural horizon for stability Lieut Doolittle uses artificial horizon the small instrument which indicates longitudinal and lateral position relation the ground all time was able locate the landing field means the direction finding long distance radio beacon addition another smaller radio beacon had been installed casting beam fifteen twenty miles either direction which governs the immediate approach the field \\nlocate the landing field the pilot watches two vibrating reeds tuned the radio beacon virtual radio receiver his instrument board turns the right left his course the right left reed respectively begins doing sort Vitus dance the reeds are equilibrium the pilot knows clear sailing straight his field \\nThe sensitive altimeter showed Lieut Doolittle his altitude and made possible for him calculate his landing distance within few feet from the ground \\nProbably the strangest device all that Lieut Doolittle has been called upon test Guggenheim war against fog sort heat cannon that goes forth combat like fire breathing dragon old Like the enemies the dragon the fog supposed curl and die before the scorching breath the hot air artillery although the fundamental principle behind the device great deal more scientific than such explanation sounds brief based the known fact that fog forms only very narrow temperature zone which lies between the saturation and precipitation points the atmosphere the air grows little colder the fog turns into rain and falls warmed very slightly the mist disappears and the air once more normally clear although its humidity very close the maximum \\nBrigands the Moon \\nThe Book Gregg Haljan \\nPART TWO FOUR PART NOVEL \\nRay Cummings

him reassuringly put ear the door opening and listened the space across the grid the ventilator over bunk The hum vibration would have been audible those two points But there was nothing \\nall right whispered Anita not you who was killed can hardly realize now Not you whom they buried yesterday morning \\nstood and whispered and she clung small beside With the black robe thrown aside seemed that could not miss the curves her woman figure dangerous game she was playing Her hair had been cut short the base her neck the fashion her dead brother Her eyelashes had been clipped the line her brows altered And now the light ray tube shone upon her earnest face could remark other changes Glutz the little beauty specialist was this secret With plastic skill had altered the set her jaw with his wax put masculinity there \\nShe was whispering was was poor George whom Miko shot \\n \\nhad now the true version what had occurred Miko had been forcing his wooing upon Anita George Prince was weakling whose only good quality was love for his sister Some years ago had fallen into evil ways Been arrested and then discharged from his position with the Federated Radium Corporation had taken with evil

\\nall this Anita had been unaware She had never liked Miko Feared him And seemed that the Martian had some hold upon her brother which puzzled and frightened Anita \\nThen Miko had fallen love with her George had not liked And that night the Planetara Miko had come and knocked upon Anita door Incautiously she opened forced himself And when she repulsed him struggled with him George had been awakened \\nShe was whispering now room was dark were all three struggling George was holding the shot came and screamed \\nAnd Miko had fled not knowing whom his shot had hit the darkness \\nAnd when George died Captain Carter wanted impersonate him planned with Frank try and learn what Miko and the others were doing Because never knew that poor George had fallen into such evil things \\n \\ncould only hold her thankfully arms The lost what might have been seemed coming back \\nAnd they cut hair Gregg and Glutz altered face little and did best But there was time came upon quickly \\nAnd she whispered But love you Gregg want the first say love you love you \\nBut had the sanity try and plan \\nAnita when you back tell Miko discussed radium ores You have careful clever Don say too much Tell him estimate the treasure hundred and thirty millions \\ntold her what Miko had vouchsafed his plans She knew all that And Snap knew She had had few moments alone with Snap Gave now message from him \\npull out this Gregg \\nWith Snap she had worked out plan There were Snap and and Shac and Dud Ardley upon whom could doubtless depend And Frank Against were Miko and his sister and Coniston and Hahn course there were the members the crew But were numerically the stronger when came true leadership Unarmed and guarded now But could break loose recapture the ship \\nsat listening Anita eager whispers seemed feasible Miko did not altogether trust George Prince Anita was now unarmed \\nBut can make opportunity can get one their ray cylinders and invisible cloak equipment \\nThat cloak had been hidden Miko room when Carter searched for A20 was now the chart room Johnson body had been repaired now Anita thought she could get possession \\n \\nworked out the details the plan Anita would arm herself and come and release Together with paralyzing ray could creep aboard the ship overcome these brigands one one There were few the leaders With them felled and with control the turret and the helio room could force the crew stay their posts There were Anita said navigators among Miko crew They would not dare oppose \\nBut should done once Anita few hours will the asteroid \\nYes will now try and get the weapons \\nWhere Snap \\nStill the helio room One the crew guards him \\nConiston was roaming the ship was still loitering the deck watching our door Hahn was the turret The morning watch the crew were their posts the hull corridors the stewards were preparing morning meal There were nine members subordinates altogether Anita had calculated Six them were Miko pay the

\\nwill arrange with Venza Anita whispered swiftly She will tell the others Frank knows about now thinks can done \\n \\nThe possibility swept anew The brigands were necessity scattered singly about the ship One one creeping under cover invisible cloak could fell them and replace them without alarming the others thoughts leaped would strike down the guard the helio room Release Snap the turret could assail Hahn and replace him with Snap \\nConiston voice outside broke upon Prince \\nwas coming forward Anita stood the doorway have the figures Coniston God this Haljan with And clever think

waiting Mars wondered had been able signal The distance from here Mars was great yet upon other voyages Snap signals had gotten through heart sank the thought Our situation here was desperate enough The passengers soon would cast upon the asteroid there would left only Snap Anita and myself might recapture the ship but doubted now thoughts were turning our arrival upon the Moon three might perhaps able thwart the attack upon Grantline hold the brigands off until help from the Earth might come \\nBut with another brigand ship fully manned and armed coming from Mars the condition would

the Earthward side the Moon the giant crater Archimedes stood brooding silent majesty Grim lofty walls broken pitted and scarred rising precipitous the upper circular rim Night had just fallen The sunlight clung the crater heights tinged with flame the jagged peaks the Apennine Mountains which rose tiers the horizon and flung great inky shadows over the intervening lowlands \\nNorthward the Mare Imbrium stretched mysterious and purple its million rills and ridges and crater holes flattened distance and the gathering darkness into seeming level surface The night slowly deepened The dead black vault the sky blazed with its brilliant starry gems The gibbous Earth hung high above the horizon motionless save for the invisible pendulum sway over the tiny arc its libration widening quadrature casting upon the bleak naked Lunar landscape its mellow Earth glow \\nSlow measured process this coming the Lunar night For Earth day the sunset slowly faded the Apennines the poised Earth widened little further Earth day time with the Earth disc visibly rotating the faint tracery its oceans and continents passing slow majestic review \\nAnother Earth day interval Then another And another Full night now enveloped Archimedes Splotches Earth light and starlight sheen slowly shifted the night advanced \\nBetween the great crater and the nearby mountains the broken pseudo level lowlands lay wan the Earth light few hundred miles distance would measured upon Earth million million rills were here Valleys and ridges ravines sharp walled canyons cliffs and crags tiny craters like pock marks \\nNaked gray porous rock everywhere This denuded landscape Cracked and scarred and tumbled though some inexorable Titan torch had seared and crumbled and broken left now congealed like wind lashed sea abruptly frozen into immobility \\n \\nMoonlight upon Earth gently shines make romantic lover smile But the reality the Lunar night cold beyond human rationality Cold and darkly silent Grim desolation Awesome Majestic frowning majesty that even the most intrepid human beholder inconceivably forbidding \\nAnd there were humans here now this tumbled plain between Archimedes and the mountains one small crater amid the million its fellows was distinguished this night the presence humans The Grantline camp huddled the deepest purple shadows the side bowl like pit crudely circular orifice with scant two miles across its rippling rim There was faint light here mark the presence the living intruders The blue glow radiance Morrell tube lights under spread glassite \\nThe Grantline camp stood mid way one the inner cliff walls the little crater The broken rock strewn floor two miles wide lay five hundred feet below the camp Behind the jagged precipitous cliff rose another five hundred the heights the upper rim broad level shelf hung midway the cliff and upon Grantline had built his little group glassite dome shelters Viewed from above there was the darkly purple crater floor the upflung circular rim where the Earth light tinged the spires and crags with yellow sheen and the shelf like huddled group birds nests Grantline domes clung and gazed down upon the inner valley \\nIntricate task the building these glassite shelters There were three The main one stood close the brink the ledge quadrangle glassite walls hundred feet length half wide and scant ten feet high its flat arched dome roof Built for this purpose Great New York Grantline had brought his aluminite girders and braces and the glassite panels sections \\n \\nThe air here the Moon surface was negligible scant one five thousandth the atmospheric pressure the sea level Earth But within the glassite shelter normal Earth pressure must maintained Rigidly braced double walls withstand the explosive tendency with external pressure counteract tremendous necessity for mechanical equipment had burdened Grantline small ship its capacity The chemistry manufactured air the pressure equalizers renewers respirators the lighting and temperature maintenance systems all the mechanics space flyer were here \\nAnd within the glassite double walls there was necessity for constant circulation the Erentz temperature insulating system  \\nThere was this main Grantline building stretching low and rectangular along the front edge the ledge Within were living rooms messroom and kitchen Fifty feet behind connected narrow passage glassite was similar though smaller structure The mechanical control rooms with their humming vibrating mechanisms were here And instrument room with signaling apparatus senders receivers mirror grids and audiphones several varieties and electro telescope small but modern with dome overhead like little Earth observatory \\nFrom this instrument building beside the connecting pedestrian passage wire cables for light and air tubes and strings and bundles instrument wires ran the main structure gray snakes upon the porous gray Lunar rock \\nThe third building seemed lean banked against the cliff wall slanting shed wall glassite fifty feet high and two hundred length Under for months Grantline borers had dug into the cliff Braced tunnels were here penetrating back and downward into this vein radio active rock \\nintricate system insulation against extremes temperature developed the Erentz Kinetic Energy Corporation the twenty first century Within the hollow double shell shelter wall explorer helmet suit space flyer hull oscillating semi vacuum current was maintained extremely rarified air magnetically charged and maintained rapid oscillating motion Across this field the outer cold heat the case might could penetrate only with slow radiation This Erentz system gave the most perfect temperature insulation known its day Without interplanetary flight would have been impossible \\nAnd served double purpose Developed first for temperature insulation only the Erentz system surprisingly brought light one the most important discoveries made the realm physics the century was found that any flashing oscillating current whether electronic the semi vacuum rarified air even thin sheet whirling fluid gave also pressure insulation The kinetic energy the rapid movement was found absorb within itself the latent energy the unequal pressure \\nThe intricate postulates and mathematical formulae necessary demonstrate the operation the physical laws involved would out place here \\nThe Planetara was equipped against the explosive tendency its inner air pressures when flying the near vacuum space the case Grantline

reached the outer wall The Erentz engineers claimed for their system pressure absorption leaving Grantline case only room pressure held the building aluminite bracers \\nmay interesting note this connection that without the Erentz system basis the great sub sea developments Earth and Mars the twenty first century would also have been impossible Equipped with fluid circulation device the Erentz principle within its double hull the first submarine was able penetrate the great ocean deeps withstanding the tremendous ocean pressures depths four thousand fathoms \\n \\nThe work was over now The borers had been dismantled and packed away one end the cliff the mining equipment lay piled litter There was heap discarded ore where Grantline had carted and dumped after his first crude refining process had yielded waste The ore slag lay like gray powder flakes strewn down the cliff Tracks and ore carts along the ledge stood discarded mute evidence the weeks and months work these helmeted miners had undergone struggling upon this airless frowning world \\nBut now all that was finished The radio active ore was sufficiently concentrated lay this treasure seventy foot pile behind the glassite lean with cage wires over and insulation barrage guarding its Gamma rays from escaping mark its presence \\nThe ore shelter was dark the other two buildings were lighted And there were small lights mounted intervals about the camp and along the edge the ledge spider ladder with tiny platforms some twenty feet one above the other hung precariously the cliff face descended the five hundred feet the crater floor and behind the camp mounted the jagged cliff face the upper rim height where small observatory platform was placed \\n \\nSuch was the outer aspect the Grantline Treasure Camp near the beginning this Lunar night when unbeknown Grantline and his score men the Planetara with its brigands was approaching The night was perhaps sixth advanced Full night breath cloud mar the brilliant starry heavens The quadrant Earth hung poised like giant mellow moon over Grantline crater bright Earth yet air was here this Lunar surface spread its light Only glow mingling with the spots

and climbed with agile bounding leaps the spider ladder the dome the crater top light flashed there Then was extinguished \\nThe goggled bloated figure came leaping down after moment Grantline

before the time sleep according the camp routine Grantline was maintaining Nine Earth Eastern American time recorded now upon his Earth chronometer the living room the main building Johnny Grantline

leisure here now Their mirth had hollow sound older times explorers the frozen polar zones had cope with inactivity loneliness and despair But least they were their native world The grimness the Moon was eating into the courage Grantline men unreality here weirdness These fantastic crags The deadly silence The nights almost two weeks Earth time length congealed the deadly frigidity Space The days black sky blaring stars and flaming Sun with atmosphere diffuse the daylight Days weird blending sheen illumination with most the Sun heat radiating swiftly from the naked Lunar surface that the outer temperature still was cold And day and night always the familiar beloved Earth disc hanging poised near the zenith From thinnest crescent full Earth and then steadily back again crescent \\nAll abnormal irrational disturbing human senses With the mining work over irritability grew upon Grantline men And perhaps since the human mind wonderful elusive thing there lay upon these men indefinable sense impending disaster Johnny Grantline felt thought about now sat the room corner watching Wilks being forced into the plaget game and found strong within him Unreasonable ominous depression

not \\nFrom across the room somebody was saying the Comet hadn smashed damn but ask the Commander let some take her back The discarded equipment could \\nShut Billy She smashed \\nThe little Comet cruising search the ore had come grief just the ore was found lay now the crater floor with its nose bashed into upflung spire rock Wrecked beyond repair Save for the pre arrangement with the Planetara the Grantline party would have been helpless here the Moon Knowledge that although one ever suspected but that the Planetara would come safely served add the men depression They were cut off virtually helpless strange world Their signalling devices were inadequate even reach Earth Grantline power batteries were running low could not attempt wide flung signals without jeopardizing the power necessary for the routine his camp the event the Planetara being delayed Nor was his electro telescope adequate pick small objects any great distance  \\nAll Grantline effort truth had gone into equipment for the finding and gathering the treasure The safety the expedition had that extent been neglected \\nSwenson was mentioning that now \\nYou all agreed Johnny said shortly Every man here voted that above everything what wanted was get the radium \\nThe Gravely storage tanks the power used the Grantline expedition were heavy and bulky affairs Economy space the Comet allowed but few

THURSDAY EACH MONTH ------------------------------------- \\nThe Soul Snatcher \\nTom Curry \\nIllustration began twist and turn though torn some invisible force \\nFrom twenty miles away stabbed the atom filtering rays Allen Baker his cell the death house \\nThe shrill voice woman stabbed the steady hum the many machines the great semi darkened laboratory was the onslaught weak femininity against the ebony shadow Jared the silent negro servant Professor Ramsey Burr Not many people were able get the famous man against his wishes Jared obeyed orders implicitly and was generally efficient barrier \\nwill see him will screamed the middle aged woman Mrs Mary Baker and his fault son going die His fault Professor Professor Burr \\nJared was unable keep her quiet \\nComing from the sunlight her eyes were not yet accustomed the strange subdued haze the laboratory immense chamber crammed full equipment the vista which seemed like apartment hell Bizarre shapes stood out from the mass impedimenta great stills which rose full two stories height dynamos immense tubes colored liquids hundred puzzles the inexpert eye \\nThe small plump figure Mrs Baker was very out place this setting Her voice was poignant reedy look her made evident that she was conventional good woman She had soft cloudy golden eyes and pathetic mouth and she seemed the point tears \\nMadam madam doctor busy whispered Jared endeavoring shoo her out the laboratory with his polite hands was respectful but firm \\nShe refused obey She stopped when she was within few feet the activity the laboratory and stared with fear and horror the center the room and its occupant Professor Burr whom she had addressed during her flurried entrance \\nThe professor face peered her seemed like disembodied stare for she could see only eyes behind mask lavender gray glass eyeholes with its flapping ends dirty gray white cloth \\nShe drew deep breath and gasped for the pungent fumes acrid and penetrating sulphuric and nitric acids stabbed her lungs was like the breath hell fit the simile and aptly Professor Burr seemed the devil himself manipulating the infernal machines \\n \\nActing swiftly the tall figure stepped over and threw two switches single sweeping movement The vermillion light which had lived long row tubes nearby bench abruptly ceased writhe like many tongues flame and the embers hell died out \\nThen the professor flooded the room harsh gray green light and stopped the high pitched humming whine his dynamos shadow picture writhing the wall projected from lead glass barrel disappeared suddenly the great color filters and other machines lost their semblance horrible life and regretful sigh seemed come from the metal creatures they gave the ghost \\nthe woman had been entering the abode fear She could not restrain her shudders But she bravely confronted the tall figure Professor Burr came forth greet her \\nwas extremely tall and attenuated with red bony mask face pointed the chin sharp little goatee Feathery blond hair silvered and awry covered his great head \\nMadam said Burr gentle disarmingly quiet voice your manner entrance might have cost you your life Luckily was able deflect the rays from your person else you might not now able voice your complaint for such seems your purpose coming here turned Jared who was standing close Very well Jared You may After this will well throw the bolts though this case quite willing see the visitor \\nJared slid away leaving the plump little woman confront the famous scientist \\nFor moment Mrs Baker stared into the pale gray eyes the pupils which seemed black coal contrast Some his bitter enemies claimed that Professor Ramsey Burr looked cold and bleak iceberg others that had baleful glare His mouth was grim and determined \\n \\nYet with her woman eyes Mrs Baker looking the professor bony mask face with the high bridged intrepid nose the passionless gray eyes thought that Ramsey Burr would handsome little less cadaverous and more human \\nThe experiment which you ruined your untimely entrance continued the professor was not safe one \\nHis long white hand waved toward the bunched apparatus but her the room seemed all glittering metal coils snakelike wire ruddy copper dull lead and tubes all shapes Hell cauldrons unknown chemicals seethed and slowly bubbled beetle black bakelite fixtures reflected the hideous light \\nshe cried clasping her hands though she addressed him prayer forget your science Professor Burr and man Help Three days from now boy son whom love above all the world die \\nThree days long time said Professor Burr calmly not lose hope have intention allowing your son Allen Baker pay the price for deed mine freely confess was who was responsible for the death what was the person name Smith believe \\nwas you who made Allen get poor Smith agree the experiments which killed him and which the world blamed son she said They called the deed scientific fiend Professor Burr and perhaps they are right But Allen innocent \\nquiet ordered Burr raising his hand Remember madam your son Allen only commonplace medical man and while taught him little from vast store knowledge was ignorant and much less value science and humanity than myself you not understand can you not comprehend also that the man Smith was martyr science was loss mankind and only sentimentalists could have blamed anyone for his death should have succeeded the interchange atoms which were working and Smith would this moment hailed the first man travel through space invisible form projected radio waves had not been for the fact that the alloy which conducts the three types sinusoidal failed and burned out Yes was error calculation and Smith would now called the Lindbergh the Atom but for that Yet Smith has not died vain for have finally corrected this error science but trial and correction error and all will well \\nBut Allen Allen must not die all she cried For weeks has been the death house killing The Governor refuses him pardon nor will commute son sentence three days die the electric chair for crime which you admit you alone are responsible for Yet you remain your laboratory immersed your experiments and nothing nothing \\n \\nThe tears came now and she sobbed hysterically seemed that she was making appeal someone whom she had only forlorn hope \\nNothing repeated Burr pursing his thin lips Nothing Madam have done everything have have told you perfected the experiment successful Your son has not suffered vain and Smith name will down with the rest science martyrs one who died for the sake humanity But you wish save your son you must calm You must listen what have say and you must not fail carry out instructions the letter ready now \\nLight the light hope sprang the mother eyes She grasped his arm and stared him with shining face through tear dipped eyelashes \\nyou mean Can you save him After the Governor has refused What can you influence will snatch Allen from the jaws the law the public greatly excited and very hostile toward him \\nquiet smile played the corners Burr thin lips \\nCome said Place this cloak about you Allen wore when assisted \\nThe professor replaced his own mask and conducted the woman into the interior the laboratory \\nwill show you said Professor Burr \\nShe saw before her now long metal shelves which appeared delicately poised fine scales whose balance was registered hair line indicators two small metal cages \\nProfessor Burr stepped over row common cages set along the wall There was small menagerie there guinea pigs the martyrs the animal kingdom rabbits monkeys and some cats \\n \\nThe man science reached and dragged out mewing cat placing the right hand cage the strange table then obtained small monkey and put this animal the left hand cage beside the cat The cat the right squatted its haunches mewing pique and looking its tormentor The monkey after quick look around began investigate the upper reaches its new cage \\nOver each the animals was suspended fine curious metallic armament For several minutes while the woman puzzled how this demonstration was affect the rescue her condemned son waited impatiently the professor deftly worked the apparatus connecting wires here and there \\nready now said Burr Watch the two animals carefully \\nYes yes she replied faintly for she was half afraid \\nThe great scientist was stooping over looking the balances the indicators through microscopes \\nShe saw him reach for his switches and then brusk order caused her turn her eyes back the animals the cat the right hand cage the monkey the left \\nBoth animals screamed fear and sympathetic chorus sounded from the menagerie long purple spark danced from one gray metal pole the other over the cages the table \\nfirst Mrs Baker noticed change The spark had died the professor voice unhurried grave broke the silence \\nThe first part the experiment over said The ego \\nheavens cried the woman You driven the poor creatures mad \\n \\nShe indicated the cat That animal was clawing the top bars its cage uttering bizarre chattering sound somewhat like monkey The cat hung from the bars swinging itself back and forth trapeze then reached and hung its hind claws \\nfor the monkey was squatting the floor its cage and made strange sound its throat almost mew and hissed several times the professor \\nThey are not mad said Burr was explaining you have finished the first portion the experiment The ego personality one animal has been taken out and put into the other \\nShe was unable speak had mentioned madness was Professor Ramsey Burr crazy was likely enough Yet yet the whole thing these surroundings seemed plausible she hesitated about speaking watching with fascinated eyes the out character behavior the two beasts Burr went \\nThe second part follows once Now that the two egos have interchanged will shift the bodies When completed the monkey will have taken the place the cat and vice versa Watch \\nwas busy for some time with his levers and the smell ozone reached Mrs Baker nostrils she stared with horrified eyes the animals \\nShe blinked The sparks crackled madly the monkey mewed the cat chattered \\nWere her eyes going back her She could see neither animal distinctly they seemed shaking some cosmic disturbance and were but blurs This illusion for her seemed must optical persisted grew worse until the quaking forms the two unfortunate creatures were like much ectoplasm swift motion ghosts whirling about dark room \\nYet she could see the cages quite distinctly and the table and even the indicators the scales She closed her eyes for moment The acrid odors penetrated her lungs and she coughed opening her eyes \\n \\nNow she could see clearly again Yes she could see monkey and was climbing quite naturally about its cage was excited but monkey And the cat while protesting mightily acted like cat \\nThen she gasped Had her mind the excitement betrayed her She looked Professor Burr his lean face there was smile triumph and seemed awaiting her applause \\nShe looked again the two cages Surely first the cat had been the right hand cage and the monkey the left And now the monkey was the place where the cat had been and the cat had been shifted the left hand cage \\nwas with Smith when the alloys burned out said Burr impossible extract the ego dissolve the atoms and translate them into radio waves unless there connection with some other ego and body for such case the translated soul and body would have place Luckily for you madam was the man Smith who was killed when the alloys failed might have been Allen for was the second pole the connection \\nBut she began faintly how can this mad experiment have anything with saving boy \\nwaved impatiently her evident denseness you not understand will save Allen your son shall first switch our egos souls you say Then switch the bodies must always take this sequence why have not ascertained But always works thus \\nMrs Baker was terrified What she had just seen smacked the blackest magic yet woman her position must grasp straws The world blamed her son for the murder Smith man Professor Burr had made use might guinea pig and Allen must snatched from the death house \\nyou mean you can bring Allen from the prison here just throwing those switches she asked \\nThat But there more than that for not magic madam science you understand and there must some physical connection But with your help that can easily made \\n \\nProfessor Ramsey Burr she knew was the greatest electrical engineer the world had ever known And stood high physicist Nothing hindered him the pursuit knowledge they said knew fear and lived intellectual promontory was great that almost lost sight himself such man nothing was impossible Hope wild hope sprang Mary Baker heart and she grasped the bony hand the professor and kissed \\nbelieve believe she cried You can You can save Allen will anything anything you tell \\nVery well You visit your son daily the death house you not \\nShe nodded shiver remembrance that dread spot passed through her \\nThen you will tell him the plan and let him agree see the night preceding the electrocution will give him final instructions the exchange bodies When life spirit ego confined your son body the death house Allen will able perform the feat changing the bodies and your son flesh will join his soul which will have been temporarily inhabiting own shell you see When they find the cell where they suppose your son they will unable explain the phenomenon they can nothing but release Your son will here and can whisked away safe place concealment \\nYes yes What besides this \\nProfessor Burr pulled out drawer near hand and from extracted folded garment thin shiny material \\nThis metal cloth coated with the new alloy said matter fact tone rummaged further saying did expected you would here see and have been getting ready for your visit All prepared save few odds and ends which can easily clean the next two days Here are four cups which Allen must place under each leg his bed and this delicate little director coil you must take especial pains with slipped under your son tongue the time appointed \\n \\nShe was staring him still half fear half wonder yet she could not feel any doubt the man miraculous powers Somehow while talked her and rested those cold eyes upon her she was under the spell the great scientist Her son before the trouble into which had been dragged the professor had often hinted the abilities Ramsey Burr given her the idea that his employer was practically necromancer yet magician whose advanced scientific knowledge was correct and explainable the light reason \\nYes Allen had talked her often when was home resting from his labors with Professor Burr had spoken the new electricity discovered the famous man and also told his mother that Burr had found method separating atoms and then transforming them into form radio electricity that they could sent radio waves designated points And she now remembered the swift trial and conviction Allen the charge murder had occupied her deeply that she had forgotten all else for the time being that her son had informed her quite seriously that Professor Ramsey Burr would soon able transport human beings radio \\nNeither will injured any way the change said Burr calmly possible for now break human flesh send the atoms radio electricity and reassemble them their proper form these special transformers and atom filters \\nMrs Baker took all the apparatus presented her the professor She ventured the thought that might better perform the experiment once instead waiting until the last minute but this Professor Burr waved aside impossible needed the extra time said and there was hurry \\nShe glanced about the room and her eye took the giant switches copper with their black handles there were others gray green metal she did not recognize Many dials and meters strange her confronted the little woman These things she felt with rush gratitude toward the inanimate objects would help save her son they interested her and she began feel kindly toward the great machines \\n \\nWould Professor Burr able save Allen claimed Yes she thought could She would make Allen consent the trial even though her son had cursed the scientist and cried would never speak Ramsey Burr again \\nShe was escorted from the home the professor Jared and going out into the bright sunlit street blinked her eyes adjusted themselves the daylight after the queer light the laboratory bundle she had strange suit and the cups her purse held the tiny coil wrapped cotton \\nHow could she get the authorities consent her son having the suit The cups and the coil she might slip him herself She decided that mother would allowed give her son new underwear Yes she would say was that \\nShe started once for the prison Professor Burr laboratory was but twenty miles from the cell where her son was incarcerated \\nshe rode the train seeing people everyday attire commonplace occurrences going about her the spell Professor Burr faded and cold reason stared her the face Was nonsense this idea transporting bodies through the air invisible waves Yet she was old fashioned the age miracles had not passed for her Radio which pictures and voices could sent wireless waves was unexplainable her Perhaps \\nShe sighed and shook her head was hard believe was also hard believe that her son was deadly peril condemned death scientific fiend \\nHere was her station taxi took her the prison and after talk with the warden finally she stood there before the screen through which she could talk Allen her son \\nMother \\nHer heart lifted melted within her was always thus when spoke Allen she whispered softly \\nThey were allowed talk undisturbed \\nProfessor Burr wishes help you she said low voice \\n \\nHer son Allen Baker turned eyes misery upon her His ruddy hair was awry This young man was imaginative and could therefore suffer deeply had the gift turning platitudes into puzzles and his hazel eyes were lit with elfin quality which possible endeared him the more his mother All his life had been the greatest thing the world this woman see him such straits tore her very heart When had been little boy she had been able make joy appear those eyes word and pat now that was man the matter was more difficult but she had always done her best \\ncannot allow Professor Burr anything for said dully his fault that here \\nBut Allen you must listen listen carefully Professor Burr can save you says was all mistake the alloy was wrong has not come forward before because knew would able iron out the trouble had time and thus snatch you from this terrible place \\nShe put much confidence into her voice she could She must enhearten her son Anything replace that look suffering with one hope She would believe she did believe The bars the great masses stone which enclosed her son would nothing would pass through them unseen unheard \\nFor time Allen spoke bitterly Ramsey Burr but his mother pleaded with him telling him was his only chance and that the deviltry Allen suspected was imaginary \\nkilled Smith such experiment said Allen took the blame you know though only followed his instructions But you say claims have found the correct alloys \\nYes And this suit you must put But Professor Burr himself will here see you day after morrow the day preceding the the She bit her lip and got out the dreaded word the electrocution But there won any electrocution Allen there cannot You will safe safe arms She had fight now hold her belief the miracle which Burr had promised The solid steel and stone dismayed her brain \\n \\nThe new alloy seemed interest Allen Baker His mother told him the exchange the monkey and the cat and nodded excitedly growing more and more restive and his eyes began shine with hope and curiosity \\nhave told the warden about the suit saying was something made for you myself she said low voice You must pretend the coil and the cups are things you desire for your own amusement You know they have allowed you great deal latitude since you are educated and need diversion \\nYes yes There may some difficulty but will overcome that Tell Burr come talk with him and can instruct the final details better than waiting here like rat trap have been afraid going mad mother but this buoys \\nsmiled her and her heart sang the joy relief \\nHow did the intervening days pass Mrs Baker could not sleep could scarcely eat she could nothing but wait wait wait She watched the meeting her son and Ramsey Burr the day preceding the date set for the execution \\nWell Baker said Burr nonchalantly nodding his former assistant How are you \\nYou see how said Allen coldly \\nYes yes Well listen what have say and note carefully There must slip You have the suit the cups and the director coil You must keep the suit the cups under the legs the cot you lie The director under your tongue \\nThe professor spoke further with Allen instructing him scientific terms which the woman scarcely comprehended \\nnight then eleven thirty said Burr finally ready \\n \\nAllen nodded Mrs Baker accompanied Burr from the prison \\nYou you will let with you she begged \\nhardly necessary said the professor \\nBut must must see Allen the moment free make sure all right Then want able take him away have place which can hide and soon rescued must taken out sight \\nVery well said Burr shrugging immaterial long you not interfere with the course the experiment You must sit perfectly still you must not speak until Allen stands before you and addresses you \\nYes will obey you she promised \\nMrs Baker watched Professor Ramsey Burr eat his supper Burr himself was not the least perturbed was wonderful she thought that could calm her was the great moment the moment when her son would saved from the jaws death \\nJared carried comfortable chair into the laboratory and she sat quiet mouse one corner the room \\nwas nine clock and Professor Burr was busy with his preparations She knew had been working steadily for the past few days She gripped the arms her chair and her heart burned within her \\nThe professor was making sure his apparatus tested this bulb and that and carefully inspected the curious oscillating platform over which was suspended thickly bunched group gray green wire which was seemingly antenna The numerous indicators and implements seemed satisfactory for quarter after eleven Burr gave exclamation pleasure and nodded himself \\nBurr seemed have forgotten the woman spoke aloud occasionally but not her drew forth suit made the same metal cloth Allen must have this moment \\n \\nThe tension was terrific terrific for the mother who was awaiting the culmination the experiment which would rescue her son from the electric chair would fail She shuddered What Burr were mad \\nBut look him she was sure was sane sane she was \\nwill succeed she murmured digging her nails into the palms her hands know will \\nShe pushed aside the picture what would happen the morrow but few hours distant when Allen her son was due led legal death the electric chair \\nProfessor Burr placed the shiny suit upon his lank form and she saw him put duplicate coil the same sort small machine which Allen possessed under his tongue \\nThe Mephistophelian figure consulted matter fact watch that moment Mrs Baker heard above the hum the myriad machines the laboratory the slow chiming clock was the moment set for the deed \\nThen she feared the professor was insane for suddenly leaped the high bench the table which stood one the oscillating platforms \\nWires led out from this and Burr sat gently upon strange figure the subdued light \\nProfessor Burr however she soon saw was not insane this was part was reaching for switches near hand and bulbs began glow with unpleasant light needles indicators swung madly and last Professor Burr kicked over giant switch which seemed the final movement \\nFor several seconds the professor did not move Then his body grew rigid and twisted few times His face though not drawn pain yet twitched galvanically though actuated slight jabs electricity \\n \\nThe many tubes fluoresced flared pulsing waves violet and pink there were gray bars invisibility areas air which nothing visible showed There came the faint crackling hum machinery rather like swarm wasps anger Blue and gray thread fire spat across the antenna The odor ozone came Mrs Baker nostrils and the acid odors burned her lungs \\nShe was staring him staring the professor face She half rose from her chair and uttered little cry \\nThe eyes had changed longer were they cold impersonal the eyes man who prided himself the fact that kept his arteries soft and his heart hard they were loving soft eyes \\nAllen she cried \\nYes without doubt the eyes her son were looking her out the body Professor Ramsey Burr \\nMother said gently Don alarmed successful here Professor Burr body \\nYes she cried hysterically was too weird believe seemed dim her unearthly \\nAre you all right darling she asked timidly \\nYes felt nothing beyond momentary giddy spell bit nausea and mental stiffness was strange and have slight headache However all well \\ngrinned her laughed with the voice which was not his yet which she recognized directed her son spirit The laugh was cracked and unlike Allen whole hearted mirth yet she smiled sympathy \\nYes the first part success said the man Our egos have interchanged Soon our bodies will undergo the transformation and then must keep under cover dislike Burr yet great man has saved suppose the slight headache which feel one bequeathed Burr hope inherits shivers and terrors and the neuralgia for the time being will get some idea what have undergone \\nhad got down from the oscillating platform the spirit her son Ramsey body \\nWhat what are you doing now she asked \\nmust carry out the rest myself said Burr directed when talked yesterday more difficult when one subject out the laboratory and the tubes must checked \\n \\nwent carefully about his work and she saw him replacing four the tubes with others new ones which were ready hand Though was the body Ramsey Burr the movements were different from the slow precise work the professor and more and more she realized that her son inhabited the shell before her \\nFor moment the mother thought attempting dissuade her son from making the final change was not better thus than chance the disintegration the bodies Suppose something went wrong and the exchange did not take place and her son that his spirit went back the death house \\nMidnight struck worked feverishly the apparatus the long face corrugated checked the dials and tubes worked swiftly but evidently was following procedure which had committed memory for was forced pause often make sure himself \\nEverything said the strange voice last consulted his watch Twelve thirty said \\nShe bit her lip terror cried Now and sprang the table take his place the metallic platform which oscillated and fro under his weight The delicate grayish metal antenna which she knew would form glittering halo blue and gray threads fire rested quiescent above his head \\nThis the last thing said calmly reached for the big ebony handled switch myself few minutes mother \\nYes son yes \\nThe switch connected and Allen Baker the form Ramsey Burr suddenly cried out pain His mother leaped run his side but waved her away She stood wringing her hands began twist and turn though torn some invisible force Eery screams came from the throat the man the platform and Mrs Baker cries sympathy mingled with them \\n \\nThe mighty motors hummed high pitched unnatural whine and suddenly Mrs Baker saw the tortured face before her grow dim The countenance the professor seemed melt and then there came dull muffled thud burst white blue flame the odor burning rubber and the tinkle broken glass \\nBack the face came the clarity outline and still was Professor Ramsey Burr body she stared \\nHer son the professor shape climbed from the platform and looked about him though dazed acrid smoke filled the room and burning insulation assailed the nostrils \\nDesperately without looking her his lips set determined line the man went hurriedly over the apparatus again \\nHave forgotten did anything wrong she heard his anguished cry \\nTwo tubes were burned out and these replaced swiftly possible But was forced all over the wiring and cut out whatever had been short circuited that could hooked anew with uninjured wire \\nBefore was ready resume his seat the platform after half hour feverish haste knock came the door \\nThe person outside was imperative and Mrs Baker ran over and opened the portal Jared the whites his eyes shining the dim light stood there professah tell him dat wahden wishes talk with him very important \\nThe body Burr inhabited Allen soul pushed her and she followed falteringly wringing her hands She saw the tall figure snatch the receiver and listen \\nGod cried \\nlast put the receiver back the hook automatically and sank down chair his face his hands \\n \\nMrs Baker went him quickly What Allen she cried \\nMother said hoarsely was the warden the prison told that Allen Baker had gone temporarily insane and claimed Professor Ramsey Burr body \\nBut but what the matter she asked Cannot you finish the experiment Allen Can you change the two bodies now \\nshook his head Mother they electrocuted Ramsey Burr body twelve forty five night \\nShe screamed She was faint but she controlled herself with great effort \\nBut the electrocution was not until morning she said \\nAllen shook his head They are allowed certain latitude about twelve hours said Burr protested the last moment and begged for time \\nThen then they must have come for him and dragged him forth die the electric chair while you were attempting the second part the change she said \\nYes That was why failed That why the tubes and wires burned out and why couldn exchange bodies began succeed then could feel something terrible had happened was impossible complete the Beta circuit which short circuited They took him from the cell you see while was starting the exchange the atoms \\n \\nFor time the mother and her boy sat staring one another She saw the tall eccentric figure Ramsey Burr before her yet she saw also the soul her son within that form The eyes were Allen the voice was soft and loving and his spirit was with her \\nCome Allen son she said softly \\nBurr paid the price said Allen shaking his head became martyr science \\nThe world has wondered why Professor Ramsey Burr much the headlines great scientist suddenly gave all his experiments and took the practice medicine \\nNow that the public furor and indignation over the death the man Smith has died down sentimentalists believe that Ramsey Burr has reformed and changed his icy nature for manifests great affection and care for Mrs Mary Baker the mother the electrocuted man who had been his assistant

his head lower over the spectroscope with which was working The knock was repeated with quality quiet insistence upon recognition The Doctor smothered exclamation impatience and strode over the door and threw open the knocker \\nhello Carnes exclaimed recognized his visitor Come and sit down and keep your mouth shut for few minutes busy just now but liberty little while \\nIllustration \\nThere hurry Doctor replied Operative Carnes the United States Secret Service entered the room and sat the edge the Doctor desk haven got case sleeve this time just came for little chat \\nAll right glad see you Read that latest volume the Zeitschrift for while That article Von Beyer has got guessing all right \\nCarnes picked the indicated volume and settled himself read The Doctor bent over his apparatus Time and again made minute adjustments and gave vent muttered exclamations annoyance the results obtained Half hour later rose from his chair with sigh and turned his visitor \\nWhat you think Von Beyer alleged discovery asked the operative \\n \\ntoo deep for Doctor replied the operative All that can make out that claims have discovered new element named lunium but hasn been able isolate yet there anything remarkable about that seems that have read other new elements being discovered from time time \\nThere nothing remarkable about the discovery new element the spectroscopic method replied Bird know from Mendeleff table that there are number elements which have not discovered yet and several the ones know were first detected the spectroscope The thing which puzzles that brilliant man Von Beyer claims have discovered the spectra the moon His name lunium taken from Luna the moon \\nWhy not the moon Haven several elements been first discovered the spectra stars \\nCertainly The classic example Lockyer discovery orange line the spectra the sun 1868 known terrestrial element gave such line and named the new element which deduced helium from Helos the sun The element helium was first isolated Ramsey some twenty seven years later Other elements have been found the spectra stars but the point making that the sun and the stars are incandescent bodies and could logically expected show the characteristic lines their constituent elements their spectra But the moon cold body without atmosphere and visible only reflected light The element lunium may exist the moon but the manifestations which Von Beyer has observed must not from the moon but from the source the reflected light which spectro analyzed \\n \\nYou are over depth Doctor \\nover own have tried follow Von Beyer reasoning and have tried check his findings Twice this evening thought that caught momentary glimpse the screen fluoroscope the ultra violet line which reports characteristic lunium but not certain haven been able photograph yet notes his article that the line seems quite impermanent and fades rapidly that accurate measurement its wave length almost impossible However let drop the subject How you like your new assignment \\nall right would rather back old work \\nhaven seen you since you were assigned the Presidential detail suppose that you fellows are pretty busy getting ready for Premier McDougal visit \\ndoubt will come replied Carnes soberly Things are not exactly propitious for visit that sort just now \\n \\nBird sat back his chair surprise \\nthought that the whole thing arranged The press seems think any rate \\nEverything arranged but arrangements may cancelled wouldn surprised hear that they were \\nCarnes replied Bird gravely you have either said too much too little There something more this than appears the surface none business don hesitate tell and forget what you have said but can help you any speak \\nCarnes puffed meditatively his pipe for few minutes before replying \\nreally none your business Doctor said length and yet know that corpse chatterbox compared you when you are told anything confidence and really need unload mind has been kept from the press far but don know how long can kept muzzled strict confidence the President the United State acts though were crazy \\nQuite section the press has claimed that for long time replied Bird with twinkle his eye \\ndon mean crazy that way Doctor mean really crazy Bugs Nuts Bats his belfry \\n \\nBird whistled softly \\nAre you sure Carnes asked \\nsure may Both his physicians think They were non committal for while especially the first attack waned and seemed recover but when his second attack came more violently than the first and the President began act queerly they had take the Presidential detail into their confidence has been quietly examined some the greatest psychiatrists the country but none them have ventured positive verdict the nature the malady They admit course that exists but they won classify The fact that intermittent seems have them stopped was bad month ago but recovered and became all appearances normal for time About week ago began show queer symptoms again and now getting worse daily goes getting worse for another week will have announced that the Vice President can take over the duties the head the government \\n \\nWhat are the symptoms \\nThe first noticed was failing his memory Coupled with this was restlessness and habit nocturnal prowling tosses continually his bed and mutters and times leaps and rages back and forth his bedchamber howling and raging Then will calm down and compose himself and sleep only wake half hour and through the same performance pretty ghastly for the men night guard \\nHow does act the daytime \\nHeavy and lethargic His memory becomes complete blank times and talks wildly Those are the times must guard against \\nOverwork queried the Doctor \\nNot according his physicians His physical health splendid and his appetite unusually keen takes his exercise regularly and suffers ill health except for little eye trouble \\nBird leaped his feet \\nTell more about this eye trouble Carnes demanded \\nWhy don know much about Doctor Admiral Clay told that was nothing but mild opthalmia which should yield readily treatment That was when told see that the shades the President study were partially drawn keep the direct sunlight out \\n \\nOpthalmia sugared What his eyes look like \\nThey are rather red and swollen and little bloodshot has tendency shut them while talking and avoids light much possible hadn noticed anything peculiar about \\nCarnes did you ever see case snow blindness \\nThe operative looked surprise \\nYes have had myself once Maine Now that you mention his case does look like snow blindness but such thing absurd Washington August \\nBird rummaged his desk and drew out book which consulted for moment \\nNow Carnes said want some dates from you and want them accurately Don guess for great deal may depend the accuracy your answers When was this mental disability the part the President first noticed \\nCarnes drew pocket diary from his coat and consulted \\nThe seventeenth July replied That are sure view later developments that that was the date first came didn realize that anything was wrong until the twentieth the night the nineteenth the President slept very poorly getting and creating disturbance twice and the twentieth acted queerly that was necessary cancel three conferences \\n \\nBird checked off the dates the book before him and nodded \\nsaid and describe the progress the malady days \\ngot progressively worse until the night the twenty third The twenty fourth was worse and the twenty fifth slight improvement was noticed got steadily better until the third fourth August was apparently normal About the twelfth began show signs restlessness which have increased daily during the past week Last night the nineteenth slept only few minutes and Brady who was guard says that his howls were terrible His memory has been almost total blank today and all his appointments were cancelled ostensibly because his eye trouble gets any worse probably will necessary inform the country his true condition \\nWhen Carnes had finished Bird sat for time concentrated thought \\nYou did exactly right coming Carnes said presently don think that this job for doctor all believe that needs physicist and chemist and possibly detective cure him get busy \\nWhat you mean Doctor demanded Carnes you think that some exterior force causing the President disability \\n \\nthink nothing Carnes replied the Doctor grimly but intend know something before through Don ask for explanations this not the time for talk the time for action Can you get into the White House night \\ndoubt Doctor but try What excuse shall give not supposed have told you anything about the President illness \\nGet Bolton your chief the phone and tell him that you have talked when you shouldn have blow but after through exploding tell him that smell rat and that want him down here once with carte blanche authority see fit the White House makes any fuss about remind him the fact that has considered crazy several times the past when events showed that was right won play after that let talk him \\nAll right Doctor replied Carnes picked the scientist telephone and gave the number the home the Chief the Secret Service try bully him out has good deal confidence your ability \\n \\nHalf hour later the door Bird laboratory opened suddenly admit Bolton \\nHello Doctor exclaimed the Chief what the dickens have you got your mind now ought skin Carnes alive for talking out turn but you really have idea forgive him What you suspect \\nsuspect several things Bolton but haven time tell you what they are want get quietly into the White House promptly possible \\nThat easy replied Bolton but first want know what the object the visit \\nThe object see what can find out ideas are entirely too nebulous attempt lay them out before you just now You never worked directly with case before but Carnes can tell you that have own methods working and that won spill ideas until have something more definite than have present \\nThe Doctor right Chief said Carnes has idea all right but wild horses won drag out him until ready talk You have take him faith always \\nBolton hesitated moment and then shrugged his shoulders \\nHave your own way Doctor said Your reputation both scientist and unraveller tangled skeins too good for boggle about your methods Tell what you want and try get \\n \\nwant get into the White House without undue prominence being given movements and listen outside the President door for short time Later will want examine his sleeping quarters carefully and make few tests may entirely wrong assumptions but believe that there something there that requires attention \\nCome along said Bolton get you and let you listen but the rest have trust luck You may have wait until morning \\ncross that bridge when get replied the Doctor get little stuff together that may need \\nfew moments had packed some apparatus bag and taking and instrument case followed Bolton and Carnes down the stairs and out onto the grounds the Bureau Standards \\nbeautiful moon isn observed \\nCarnes assented absently the Doctor remark but Bolton paid attention the luminous disc overhead which was flooding the landscape with its mellow light \\ncar waiting announced \\nAll right old man but stop for moment and admire this moon protested the Doctor Have you ever seen finer one \\nCome and let the moon alone snorted Bolton \\ndear man absolutely refuse move step until you pause your headlong devotion duty and pay the homage due Lady Luna Don you realize you benighted Christian that you are gazing upon what has been held deity least the visible manifestation deity for ages immemorial Haven you ever had time study the history the moon worshipping cults They are old mankind you know The worship Isis was really only exalted type moon worship The crescent moon you may remember was one her most sacred emblems \\n \\nBolton paused and looked the Doctor suspiciously \\nWhat are you doing pulling leg demanded \\nNot all dear fellow Carnes doesn the sight the glowing orb night influence you pious meditation upon the frailty human life and the insignificance human ambition \\nNot any very great degree replied Carnes dryly \\nCarnesy old dear fear that you are crass materialist beginning despair ever inculcating you any respect for the finer and subtler things life must try Bolton Bolton have you ever seen finer moon Remember that won move step until you have carefully considered the matter and fully answered question \\nBolton looked first the Doctor then Carnes and finally looked reluctantly the moon \\nfine one admitted but all full moons look large clear nights this time the year \\nThen you have studied the moon cried Bird with delight was sure \\n \\nbroke off his speech suddenly and listened From distance came the mournful howl dog was answered moment another howl from different direction Dog after dog took the chorus until the air was filled with the melancholy wailing the animals \\nSee Bolton remarked the Doctor even the dogs feel the chastening influence the Lady Night and repent the sins their youth and the follies their manhood should one say doghood Come along feel that the call duty must tear away from the contemplation the beauties nature \\nled the way Bolton car and got without further words half hour later Bolton led the way into the White House word the secret service operative guard the door admitted him and his party and led the way the newly constructed solarium where the President slept operative stood outside the door \\nWhat word Brady asked Bolton whisper \\nseems worse sir doubt has slept all Admiral Clay has been several times but didn much good There listen The President getting again \\n \\nFrom behind the closed door which confronted them came sounds person rising from bed and pacing the floor slowly first and then more and more rapidly until was almost run series groans came the watchers and then long drawn out howl Bolton shuddered \\nPoor devil muttered \\nBird shot quick glance around \\nWhere Admiral Clay asked \\nsleeping upstairs Shall call him \\n Take his room \\nThe President naval physician opened the door response Bolton knock \\nworse demanded anxiously \\ndon think Admiral replied Bolton want introduce you Bird the Bureau Standards wants talk with you about the case \\nhonored Doctor said the physician grasped the scientist outstretched hand Come Pardon appearance but was startled out doze when you knocked Have chair and tell how can serve you \\nBird drew notebook from his pocket \\nhave received certain dates connection with the President malady from Operative Carnes said and wish you verify them \\nPardon moment Doctor interrupted the Admiral but may ask what your connection with the matter was not aware that you were physician surgeon \\n \\nBird here the authority the secret service replied Bolton has connection with the medical treatment the President but permit remind you that the secret service responsible for the safety the President and have right demand such details about him are necessary for his proper protection \\nhave intention obstructing you the proper performance your duties Bolton began the Admiral stiffly \\nPardon Admiral broke Bird seems that are getting started wrong suspect that certain exterior forces are more less concerned this case and have communicated suspicions Bolton turn brought here order request from you your cooperation the matter have idea demanding anything and are really seeking help which believe that you can give \\nPardon Admiral said Bolton had intention angering you \\nyour service gentlemen replied Admiral Clay What information did you wish Doctor \\nfirst merely verification the history the case have \\n \\nBird read the notes had taken down from Carnes and the Admiral nodded agreement \\nThose dates are correct said \\nNow Admiral there are two further points which wish enlightenment The first the opthalmia which troubling the patient \\nnothing alarmed about far symptoms Doctor replied the Admiral rather mild case irritation somewhat analogous granuloma but rather stubborn had attack several weeks ago and while did not yield treatment readily could have wished did clear nicely couple weeks and was quite surprised this recurrent attack His sight danger \\nHave you tried connect this opthalmia with his mental aberrations \\nWhy Doctor there connection \\nAre you sure \\ncertain The slight pain which his eyes give him could never have such effect upon the mind able and energetic man \\nWell let that pass for the moment The other question this has any form skin trouble \\n \\nThe Admiral looked surprise \\nYes has admitted had mentioned one for really amounts nothing but has slight attack some obscure form dermatitis which treating affecting only his face and hands \\nPlease describe \\nhas taken the form brown pigmentation the hands the face causes slight itching and subsequent peeling the affected areas \\nother words acting like sunburn \\nWhy yes somewhat not that however for has been exposed the sun very little lately account his eyes \\nnotice that sleeping the new solarium which was added last winter the executive mansion Can you tell with what type glass equipped \\nYes not equipped with glass all but with fused quartz \\nWhen did start sleep there \\nsoon was completed \\nAnd all the time the windows have been fused quartz \\n They were glazed first but the glass was removed and the fused quartz substituted suggestion about two months ago just before this trouble started \\nThank you Admiral You have given several things think about ideas are little too nebulous share yet but think that can give you one piece very sound advice The President spending very restless night you would remove him from the solarium and get him lie down room which glazed with ordinary glass and pull down the shades that will the dark think that will pass better night \\n \\nAdmiral Clay looked keenly into the piercing black eyes the Doctor \\nknow something you reputation Bird said slowly and will follow your advice Will you tell why you make this particular suggestion \\nthat can work that solarium night without interruption replied Bird have some tests which wish carry out while still dark results are negative forget what have told you they yield any information will glad share with you the proper time Now get the President out that solarium and tell when the coast clear \\nThe Admiral donned dressing gown and stepped out the room returned fifteen minutes \\nThe solarium your disposal Doctor announced Shall accompany you \\nyou wish assented Bird picked his apparatus and strode out the room \\nthe solarium glanced quickly around noting the position each the articles furniture \\npresume that the President always sleeps with his head this direction remarked pointing the pillow the disturbed bed \\nThe Admiral nodded assent Bird opened the bag which had packed his laboratory took out sheet cardboard covered with metallic looking substance and placed the pillow stepped back and donned pair smoked glasses watching intently Without word took off the glasses and handed them the Admiral The Admiral donned them and looked the pillow did exclamation broke from his lips \\nThat plate seems glow said astonished voice \\n \\nBird stepped forward and laid his hand the pillow was wearing wrist watch with radiolite dial The substance suddenly increased its luminescence and began glow fiercely long luminous streamers seeming come from the dial The Doctor took away his hand and substituted bottle liquid for the plate the pillow Immediately the bottle began glow with phosphorescent light \\nWhat earth gasped Carnes \\nExcitation radioactive fluid replied the Doctor The question what exciting Somebody get stepladder \\nWhile Bolton was gone after the ladder the Doctor took from his bag what looked like ordinary pane glass \\nTake this Carnes directed and start holding over each those panes quartz which you can reach Stop when tell you \\n \\nThe operative held the glass over each the panes succession but the Doctor who kept his eyes covered with the smoked glasses and fastened the plate which had replaced the pillow said nothing When Bolton arrived with the ladder the process went One end and most the front the solarium had been covered before exclamation from the Doctor halted the work \\nThat the one exclaimed Hold the glass there for moment \\nHurriedly removed the plate from the pillow and replaced the phial liquid There was only very feeble glow \\nGood enough cried Take away the glass but mark that pane and ready replace when give the word \\nFrom the instrument case had brought took out spectroscope turned back the mattress and mounted the bedstead \\nCover that pane directed \\nCarnes did and the Doctor swung the receiving tube the instrument until pointed the covered pane glanced into the eyepiece and then held tiny flashlight for instant opposite the third tube \\nUncover that pane said \\nCarnes took down the glass plate and the Doctor gazed into the instrument made some adjustments \\nAre you familiar with spectroscopy Admiral asked \\nSomewhat \\nTake squint here and tell what you see \\n \\nThe Admiral applied his eye the instrument and looked long and earnestly \\nThere are some lines there Doctor said but your instrument badly out adjustment They are what should the ultra violet sector according your scale \\nforgot tell you that this fluoroscopic spectroscope designed for the detection ultra violet lines replied Bird Those lines you see are ultra violet made visible the eye activation radioactive compound whose rays turn impinge zinc blende sheet you recognize the lines \\ndon \\nSmall wonder doubt whether there are dozen people who would have never seen them before although recognize them from descriptions have read Bolton come here Sight along this instrument and through that plate glass which Carnes holding and tell what office that window belongs \\nBolton sighted directed the side the State War and Navy Building \\ncan tell exactly this time night Doctor said but into the building and find out \\n Have you flashlight \\nYes \\nFlash momentarily out each the suspected windows turn until you get answering flash from here When you flash out each pane glass the window until you get another flash from here Then come back and tell what office Mark the pane that can locate again the morning \\n \\nthe office the Assistant the Adjutant General the Army reported Bolton ten minutes later \\nWhat there the room \\nNothing but the usual desks and chairs \\nsuspected much The window merely reflector That all that can for night gentlemen Admiral keep your patient quiet and room with glass windows preferably with the shades drawn until further notice Bolton meet here with Carnes sunrise Have picked detail ten men standing where can get hold them hurry the mean time get the Chief Air Service out bed and have him order plane Langley Field ready take off not take off however until give him orders you understand \\nEverything will ready for you Doctor but confess that don know what all about \\nthe biggest case you ever tackled old man and hope that can pull off successfully like over with you now but busy the Bureau for the rest the night Drop off there will you \\nsunrise the next morning Bolton met Bird the entrance the White House grounds \\nWhere your detail asked \\nthe State War and Navy Building \\nGood want the solarium put light the place where the President pillow was last night and mark that pane quartz were looking through Then join the detail \\n \\nBird placed the light and walked with Carnes across the White House grounds Bolton badge secured admission the State War and Navy Building for the party and they made their way the office the Assistant the Adjutant General \\nDid you mark the pane glass through which you flashed your light last night Bolton asked the Doctor \\nThe detective touched one the panes \\nGood exclaimed the Doctor notice that this window has hooks for window washer belt Get life belt will you \\nWhen the belt was brought the Doctor turned Carnes \\nCarnes said hook this life saver and climb out the window ledge Take this piece apparatus with you \\nhanded Carnes piece apparatus which looked like two telescopes fastened base with screw adjustment for altering the angles the barrels \\n \\nCarnes took and looked inquiringly \\nThat what was making the Bureau last night explained Bird device which will enable locate the source the beam which was reflected from this pane glass onto the President pillow show you how work You know that when light reflected the angle reflection always equals the angle incidence Well you place these three feet against the pane glass thus putting the base the instrument plane parallel the pane glass turning these two knobs one which gives lateral and the other vertical adjustment you will manipulate the instrument until the first telescope pointing directly toward the President pillow Now notice that the two telescope barrels are fastened together and are connected the knobs that when the knobs are turned the scopes are turned equal and opposite amounts When one turned from its present position five degrees the west the other automatically turns five degrees the east When one elevated the other correspondingly depressed Thus when the first tube points toward the pillow the other will point toward the source the reflected beam \\nClever ejaculated Bolton \\nrather crude and may not accurate enough locate the source exactly but least will give pretty good idea where look Given time much more accurate instrument could have been made but two telescopic rifle sights and theodolite base were all the materials could find work with Climb out Carnesy and your stuff \\n \\nCarnes climbed out the window and fastened the hooks the life saver the rings set the window casings sat the base the instrument against the pane glass and manipulated the telescope knobs Bird signalled from the inside The scientist was hard please with the adjustment but last the cross hairs the first telescope were centered the light the solarium changed his position and stared through the second tube \\nThe angle too acute and the distance too great for accuracy said with air disappointment The beam comes from the roof house down along Pennsylvania Avenue but can tell from here which one Take look Bolton \\nThe Chief the Secret Service stared through the telescope \\ncouldn sure Doctor replied can see something the roof one the houses but can tell what and couldn tell the house when got front \\nwon make false move said the Doctor Did you arrange for that plane \\nwaiting your orders the field Doctor \\nGood the office the Chief Air Service and get touch with the pilot over the Chief private line There are some orders that wish give him and some signals arranged \\n \\nBird returned few minutes \\nThe plane taking off now and will over the city soon announced take stroll down the Avenue until are the vicinity the house and then wait for the plane Carnes will take five your men and down behind the house and the rest will front Which building you think Bolton \\nAbout the fourth from the corner \\nAll right the men going down the back will take station behind the house next the corner and the rest will get front the same building When the plane comes over watch you receive signal the next house and wait for him make loop and come over you again Continue this until the pilot throws white parachute over That the signal that are covering the right house When you get that signal Carnes leave two men outside and break with the other three Get that apparatus the roof and the men who are operating Bolton and will attack the front door the same time Does everybody understand \\nMurmurs assent came from the detail \\nAll right let Carnes lead out with your men and half block ahead that the two parties will arrive position about the same time \\n \\nCarnes left the building with five the operatives Bird and Bolton waited for few minutes and then started down Pennsylvania Avenue the five men their squad following intervals For three quarters mile they sauntered down the street \\nThis should Doctor said Bolton \\nthink and here comes our plane \\nThey watched the swift scout plane from Langley Field swing down low over the house and then swoop into the sky again without making signal The party walked down the street one house and paused Again the plane swept over them without sign they stopped front the next house white parachute flew from the cockpit the plane and the aircraft its mission accomplished veered off the south toward its hangar \\nThis the place cried Bolton Haggerty and Johnson you two cover the street Bemis take the lower door The rest come with \\n \\nFollowed closely Bird and two operatives Bolton sprinted across the street and the steps leading the main entrance the house The door was barred and hurled his weight against without result \\nOne side Bolton snapped Bird \\nThe diminutive Chief drew aside and Bird two hundred pounds bone and muscle crashed against the door The lock gave and the Doctor barely saved himself from sprawling headlong the hall floor woman scream rang out and the Doctor swore under his breath \\nUpstairs the roof cried \\nFollowed the rest the party sprinted the stairway which opened before him Just reached the top his way was barred Amazonian figure green bathrobe \\nWho divil arre yer demanded outraged voice \\nPolice snapped Bolton One side \\nWan side demanded the fiery haired Amazon The divil stip until till bizness Phwat divil arre yer doin house rayspictable female this hour marnin \\nOne side tell you cried Bolton strove push past the figure that barred the way \\nwud wud yer little mann demanded the Irishwoman she grasped Bolton the collar and shook him terrier does rat Bird stifled his laughter with difficulty and seized her the arm With heave Bolton collar she raised him from the ground and swung him against the Doctor knocking him off his feet \\nHilp lice Murther she screamed the top her voice \\nDamn woman \\n \\nBird voice was cut short the sound pistol shot from the roof followed two others The Irishwoman dropped Bolton and slumped into sitting position and screamed lustily Bolton and Bird with the two operatives their heels raced for the roof Before they reached another volley shots rang out these sounding from the rear the building They made their way the upper floor and found ladder running skylight the roof the foot the ladder stood one Carnes party \\nWhat Williams demanded Bolton \\ndon know Chief Carnes and the other two went there and then heard shooting orders were let one come down the ladder \\nspoke Carnes head appeared the skylight \\nthe right place all right Doctor called Come the shooting all over \\n \\nBird mounted the ladder and stepped out the roof Set one edge was large piece apparatus toward which the scientist eagerly hastened bent over for few moments and then straightened \\nWhere the operator asked \\nCarnes silently led the way the edge the roof and pointed down Bird leaned over the foot the fire escape saw crumpled dark heap with secret service operative bending over \\ndead Olmstead called Carnes \\nDead mackerel came the reply Richards got him through the head his first shot \\nGood business said Bird probably could never have secured conviction and the matter best hushed anyway Bolton have two your men help get this apparatus the Bureau want examine little Have the body taken the morgue and shut the press Find out which room the chap occupied and search and bring all his papers From criminal standpoint this case settled but want look into the scientific end little more \\nlike know what was all about Doctor protested Bolton have followed your lead blindly and now have housebreaking without search warrant and killing explain and still about much the dark was the beginning \\nExcuse Bolton said Bird contritely didn mean slight you Admiral Clay wants know about and does Carnes although knows too well say soon have digested the case let you know and over the whole thing with you \\n \\nweek later Bird sat conference with the President the executive office the White House Beside him sat Admiral Clay Carnes and Bolton \\nhave told the President much know Doctor said the Admiral and would like hear the details from your lips has fully recovered from his malady and there danger exciting him \\ncannot read Russian said Bird slowly and was forced depend one assistants translate the papers which Bolton found Stokowsky room There nothing them definitely connect him with the Russian Union Soviet Republics but there little doubt mind that was Red agent and that Russia supplied the money which spent would disastrous Russia plans have too close accord between this country and the British Empire and have doubt that the coming visit Premier McDougal was the underlying cause the attempt much for the reason \\nhow came suspect what was happening the explanation very simple When Carnes first told your malady President happened checking Von Beyer results the alleged discovery new element lunium the article describing his experiments Von Beyer mentions that when tried observe the spectra encountered mild form opthalmia which was quite stubborn treatment also mentions peculiar mental unbalance and intense exhilaration which the rays seemed cause both himself and his assistants The analogy between his observations and your case struck once \\n \\nFor ages the moon has been object worship various religious sects and some the most obscene orgies which have record occurred the moonlight The full moon seems affect dogs state partial hypnosis with consequent howling and evident pain the eyes Certain feeble minded persons have been known adversely affected moonlight well some cases complete mental aberration other words while moonlight has practical effect the normal human its usual concentration does have adverse effect certain types mentality and despite the laughter medical science there seems something the theory moon madness This effect Von Beyer attributed the emanations lunium which element detected the spectra the moon the form wide band the ultra violet region \\n \\nobtained from Carnes history your case and when found that your attacks grew violent with the full moon and subsided with the new moon was sure that was the right track although had that time way knowing whether was from natural artificial causes that the effect was being produced interviewed Admiral Clay and found that you were suffering from form dermititis resembling sunburn and that convinced that attack was being made your sanity for excess ultra violet light will always tend produce sunburn inquired about the windows your solarium for ultra violet light will not pass through lead glass When the Admiral told that the glass had been replaced with fused quartz which quite permeable ultra violet and that the change had been almost coincident with the start your malady asked him get you out the solarium and let examine \\nmeans certain fluorescent substances which used found that your pillow was being bathed flood ultra violet light and the fluoro spectroscope soon told that lunium emanations were present large quantities These rays were not coming you directly from their source but one the windows the State War and Navy Building was being used reflector located the approximate source the ray means improvised apparatus and surrounded the place Stokowsky was killed while attempting escape guess that about all there \\nThank you Doctor said the President would interested description the apparatus which used produce this effect \\n \\nThe apparatus was quite simple Sir was merely large collector moonlight which was thrown after collection onto lunium plate The resultant emanations were turned into parallel beam parabolic reflector and focused through rock crystal lens with extremely long focal length onto your pillow \\nThen Stokowsky had isolated Von Beyer new element asked the President \\nstill doubt whether new element merely allotropic modification the common element cadmium The plate which used has very peculiar property When moonlight any other reflected light the same composition falls acts the ray much the button Roentgen tube acts cathode ray the cathode ray absorbed and entirely new ray the ray given off the button just the reflected moonlight absorbed and new ray ultra violet given off This the ray which Von Beyer detected thought that could catch traces Von Beyer lines spectroscope and think now that due trace lunium the cadmium plating the barrels Von Beyer could have easily made the same mistake Von Beyer work together with Stokowsky opens entirely new field spectroscopic research would give good deal over Baden and into the matter with Von Beyer and make some plans for the exploitation the new field but afraid that pocketbook wouldn stand the trip \\nthink that the United States owes you that trip Bird said the Chief Executive with smile Make your plans soon you get your data together think that the Treasury will able take care the expense without raising the income tax next year

presented lovers Science Fiction everywhere new magazine with brand new policy Astounding Stories and now the Editor great pleasure announce our thousands friends that this new magazine enjoying splendid success \\nWithin twenty four hours the time that Astounding Stories was released for sale letters praise began pouring into our office and and this significant many them clearly revealed that their writers had grasped the essential difference the new Science Fiction magazine over the others \\ncannot better state this difference this improvement than quoting what the Reader whose letter appears under the caption And Kind Their Grandmothers says his very first paragraph And was still more pleased and surprised find that the Editor seems know that such stories should have real story interest besides scientific idea exactly that Every story that appears Astounding Stories not only must contain some the forecasted scientific achievements morrow but must told vividly excitingly with all the human interest that goes make any story enjoyable day \\nThe Editor and staff Astounding Stories express their sincere thanks all who have contributed our splendid start especially those who had the kindness write with their helpful criticism \\nAlready one your common suggestions has been taken and embodied our magazine and have this new department The Readers Corner which from now will informal meeting place for all readers Astounding Stories want you never forget that cordial and perpetual invitation extended you write and talk over with all anything interest you may have say connection with our magazine \\nyou can toss word praise that fine only criticism welcome that just much for may able find from way improve our magazine you have your own private theory how airplanes will run 2500 you think the real Fourth Dimension different from what sometimes described write and share your views with all \\nThis department all yours and the job running and making interesting largely you come over The Readers Corner and have your share what everyone will saying \\nThe Editor \\nAnd Kind Their Grandmothers \\nDear Editor \\nreceived pleasant surprise few days ago when found new Science Fiction magazine the newsstand Astounding Stories And was still more pleased and surprised find that the Editor seems know that such stories should have real story interest besides scientific idea \\ncourse took with grain salt the invitation write the editor and give preference the kind stories like know that every editor down his heart thinks his magazine perfect fact praise what they want not suggestions judging the letters they print \\nWell can conscientiously give you some praise Astounding Stories keep the standard the first issue will all right Evidently you can afford hire the best writers obtainable Notice you signed some favorites Murray Leinster Starzl Ray Cummings like their stuff because has the rare quality rather vaguely described distinction which make the story remembered for long time \\nThe story Tanks Murray Leinster idea what such story should The author does not start out Listen children and you shall hear story wonderful you won believe Only after the death Professor Bulging Dome dare make public doubting world simply proceeds tell the story were reading the Saturday Evening Post Ladies Home Journal would all right prepare for the story explaining that course the author does not vouch for the story having been told him crazy Eurasian Cottage Grove black and tan speakeasy Astounding Stories expect the story unusual don bother telling That criticism applies Phantoms Reality which story above the average though despite its rather flat title and slow beginning \\nHere another good point about Tanks Its characters are human Some authors stories the future make their characters all brains cold monsters with humanity them Such story has neither human interest nor plausibility The sky the limit say for mechanical scientific accomplishments but human emotions will the same thousand years from now And even supposing that they will changed your readers have present day emotions The magazine can not prosper unless those present day emotions are aroused and mirrored thoroughly human characters The situation may just outre you like the more unusual the better but the response normal human emotions most unusual situations that gives magazine such yours its powerful and unique kick \\nThe response the two infantrymen Tanks the strange and terrifying new warfare the future exemplifies another point would like make the fact that matter what marvels the future may bring the people who will live then will take them matter fact way Their conversation will cigarettes sag paste drinks women References the scientific marvels around them will casual and sketchy How many million words average car owner conversation would you have report give visitor from 1700 idea internal combustion engines The author skillful can convey that information other ways Yet lot stories printed have long stilted conversations which the author thinks conveying entertaining way his foundation situation Personally like lot physical action violent action preferred This probably because school teacher and sedentary habits have never written story life but the most voracious consumer stories Chicago like see the hero get into devil pickle and have him smash his way out like big tough and kind their grandmothers \\nseems that interplanetary stories offer the best vehicle for all the desirable qualities herein enumerated combined There absolutely restraint the imagination except few known astronomical facts plenty opportunity for violent and dangerous adventures strange and terrestrially impossible monsters The human actors set down the midst such terrifying conditions which they battle dauntlessly grinning they take their blows and returning them with good will cannot fail rouse the admiration the reader And make him buy the next month issue \\nBut spare please the stories which the hero arriving some other planet admitted the court the king the White race and leads their battles against the Reds the Browns the Greens and eventually marrying the king daughter who always golden haired milky white complexion and has large blue eyes Kindly reject stories interplanetary travel which member the party turns against the Earth party and allies himself with the wormlike Moon men what have you Stories which great inventor gone crazy threatens hurl the Earth into the Sun leave cold and despondent for the simple reason that crazy men are never great inventors Name great inventor who wasn perfectly sane you can The author makes the great inventor insane make plausible that should want destroy the World Well good author can find some other motive \\nOne more thing like smell feel hear and even taste the action story well see Some authors only let you see and then they don tell you whether bright subdued light The author Tanks fulfills requirements this respect least partially Walter Boyle Mrs Anna Treitz 4751 North Artesian Chicago Ill \\nPermanent Reader \\nDear
