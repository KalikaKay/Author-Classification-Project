Originally, I went through and labeled these as the ten works that I was going to use. with over 2000 works being accessed, I decided that I would rather same a little time. 

I'm saving this for future reference. The 2001 works I have selected, I am not aware if they're in there or not. Judging by the file names, I know I have at lesat one or two of them.
